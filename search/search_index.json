I've all sorts of interests and hobbies, from philosophy, photography to programming. What follows is a bit about my life and why I like programming. Writing at the speed of thought I used to dream about building a device which could record your thoughts. Suppose you were out on a run, and an idea popped into your head. It would be quite inconvenient to stop, take out your phone or pen, and jot down your thoughts - the act of recording interrupts the flow. Imagine instead that you could just think, say 'I want to visit so-and-so', and a pocket-sized device, carried by you, would dutifully record that thought verbatim. It could also add tags, such as a category, much like a note-taking app. This device wouldn't be limited by your writing speed or rate of speech. The barrier would lie not in the device, but in the user - the speed of their thought, the ultimate barrier. Unfortunately, as of the time I am writing this, no such technology exists. The fastest way we can record our thoughts now is by speech recognition technology, since we speak faster than we type. The accuracy is improving steadily. However,unlike typing, speaking offers less in the way of privacy (barring subvocalization). I like typing my thoughts out, especially on a pretty editor with a nice, monospaced font, such as VSCode with JetBrains Mono, which is my current setup. I type in Dvorak as there's more alternation between the left and right hands compared to QWERTY. There's something sublimely satisfying, seeing paragraphs of evenly spaced text fill a blank editor screen, with the squiggles of the autocorrect flashing now and then. On some days, the rain and thunder might be pouring outside, while I fix and commit code, taking care to write each subroutine and function as elegantly as possible, with no unnecessary load on the computer. This strive towards perfection annoyed even myself initially, as I often got stuck on a particular feature for days. However, it soon began to feel sort of like a meditative process, almost Zen-like, where the goal was not in the resolution of the issue, but rather in the journey itself, and the numerous libraries I picked up along the way. To me, coding is about building things and fixing those very same structures. Unlike in the real world, however, one can build anything imaginable in code. Any form of control or automation so desired is attainable, limited only by the laws of logic. Writing a program is like maintaining a garden. The collaborative process in coding is unique to the field. We write programs to automate menial tasks. Later on, we release them to the public domain, where other people build larger programs on top of them, and in turn release them. This eventually culminates in large but polished libraries such as React and Django, or refinements to the languages themselves such as ES6. When you import React from 'react' , destructure a variable with ... or debounce a function, you are calling upon the work of thousands of people who have developed these facilities, sometimes to solve the very same problem you are facing, and almost instantaneously. It is almost as if you are coding with the world at large. My Journey I started out by reading books about computer hacking. Long ago, I borrowed a book on computer security (it was a thick book with a picture of a chessboard). I read about NMAP, TCP/IP, exploits on the IIS server (CodeRed), Windows LANMAN...though I didn't understand much then, I knew I really wanted to learn more about computers. \"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.\" - Frederic P. Brooks I was interested in computers and IT since I was in primary school. The web was in its infancy then; I still remember using 56kbps dialup. Ironically, most of my interest came about when my parents locked my computer and I had to figure out ways of circumvention (booting Linux, keyloggers...). I learnt about networking from trying to configure the routers in my house mostly by trial and error - those IT people my parents called charged something north of $50 just for tweaking settings like DHCP or DNS and security. The 1999 movie 'The Matrix' was also a big inspiration to me. I read The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defence sometime in the 2000s. It read like a novel, detailing the different methods virus writers would use, and the catch up game antivirus vendors would play. Some of the methods (like polymorphic encryption, virtual machines) used by the virus writers were incredibly complicated, but yet, amazingly, the authors of the book were able to provide a detection heuristic for them. Later on, my portable hard drive, filled with most of my personal data collected over many years, crashed. My diaries, personal notes, photos were gone. That was when I began reading on filesystems ($MFT, streams, MBR/GPT) and data recovery (I couldn't buy EnCase so I made do with dd and a hex editor). Although I wasn't successful in recovering my data, I finally understood how filesystems and their fault tolerance mechanisms worked. This screenshot (20kB) is larger than the program (4kB) I briefly read about x86 assembly and reverse engineering. I was inspired by the crackers of the day (Razor 1911, FAiRLiGHT, DEViANCE) and the demoscene. People could do crazy things with pure machine code - rgba made an entire mountain simulation with music in 4kB! I tried briefly reverse engineering some small programs. I found it rather complicated, and although I did succeed with some (patching with NOPs), I never really continued programming with assembly. In high school I played mostly with the Windows OS and its internals. I had fun with bruteforcing Windows passwords with tools like L0phtCrack/Cain and Abel. It was also my introduction to the world of cryptography, spurred further by allegations that the US government was decrypting internet communications and had the capability to decrypt 128-bit AES. I've written a program to search for image duplicates via convolutional neural networks and cosine similarity in Keras. I've also reversed engineered my house DVR using Wireshark and the sockets library in Python.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/#about-myself","text":"Credits: Alex of Ithaca, NY ( CC BY 2.0 ) I work as a doctor in Singapore.

The quintessential word we hear when evaluating a fund, looking at our CPF, or even when buying insurance (ill-advised). How do we actually calculate the return of our portfolio, when we add/withdraw funds from it over the course of time? Let's consider an example. On 1 Jan 2020, John invests $100. In Jun, the market went up and his portfolio is now worth $200. He invests another $100. By the next year, on 1 Jan 2021, the markets remained flat - leaving him with $300 in his account. What is his return? Surely, his return is not $300 - $100 = $200 (200%), because he invested $200 in total. Neither does it seem to be $300 - $200 = $100 (50%) - it is clear that between Jan 20 and Jun, he made a 100% return ($100 -> $200) We know therefore his return should be between 50-200%, but what is it? There are two widely accepted ways to solve this problem, the Time - Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR), and the Money - Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR) (which is equivalent to the Internal Rate of Return, IRR). Time - Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR) Formula The product of all returns for periods where money moves in/out of the portfolio insensitive to cash inflows/outflows (i.e., it is the return one would have got if they invested everything right at the start) requires valuation of the portfolio at each time point therefore better suited for portfolio managers, who cannot control inflows/outflows Money - Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR) Also known as the Internal Rate of Return.

Looking deeper, I realized Github was having trouble provisioning the SSL certificate. The solution was to disable Cloudflare proxying . Upon doing so, I was able to get an SSL certificate provisioned for the root domain, nicholaslyz.com . The Problem Cloudflare is one of the largest CDNs, and the Free plan offers unlimited bandwidth to your site. I use it for this site. However, the configuration can be tricky... I kept getting this error for ```www.nicholaslyz.com```, but not ```nicholaslyz.com``` Here was my initial configuration: I use Github Pages with custom domains and 'Enforce HTTPS' enabled, and Cloudflare with SSL Full (Strict) . When a visitor visits www.your-site.com , Github issues a HTTPS 301 redirect from the www subdomain to the registered custom domain/subdomain (in this case your-site.com ), presenting a certificate valid for www.github.com, *.github.com, github.com, *.github.io, github.io, *.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com . This happens because Github only provisions certificates for the registered (sub)domain (in my case, nicholaslyz.com ) and not the other subdomains. Github redirects users automatically to the correct version of your page, using their Github certificate With Cloudflare proxying switched off - Firefox displays 'Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead' for the www version of the site, because the Github certificate is not valid for the www subdomain.

Example 1 - Cloudflare ON Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com example.com Proxied CNAME example.com google.com Proxied www.example.com gives the 526 error (google.com does not have a valid certificate for `www.example.com ) example.com loads google.com (Point 1 above) Example 2 - Cloudflare OFF Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com example.com DNS Only CNAME example.com google.com DNS Only www.example.com gives certificate error on browsers example.com gives certificate error on browsers This is expected browser behavior as the certificates presented by example.com and google.com do not match www.example.com and example.com respectively.

Broadly speaking, the universe of sweeteners can be divided into low- and zero-calorie sweeteners. These are: Low-calorie sweeteners. Agave syrup (marketed as low GI, but full of fructose!) Sugar Alcohols . These include: Xylitol (100% sweetness of sucrose, and prevents dental caries ) Sorbitol (40-70% sweetness of sucrose) Erythritol (60-80% sweetness of sucrose) Zero-calorie sweeteners.

End Result The final product! This is the result of about ~30 leaves from 3 separate plants in total. The taste can be described as rather sweet, with some earthy undertones. It is much less bitter compared to the raw, fresh leaf. There is another way to extract the stevia using alcohol, but I'll leave that to another day (or just buy it off iHerb). So that's it!

Or wait for the hype to tide over? \"For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\" -Alexander Pope, 1711 Over the last few years I've read investment books, discussed the markets with other speculators, and tried my hand at investing from vanilla stocks, to ETFs (both index and exotic), fixed income (think bonds and T-bills), derivatives including options 1 and futures. I studied technical analysis, from candlestick patterns to resistance/support charting and technical indicators. Sadly, nobody teaches you investing in school (unless you're studying finance). I went the long way round, both chronologically and financially, to learn investing. You don't have to , if you start with the right books and perspectives. Investors can be classified into one of 4 groups 2 : You believe you can pick winning stocks at the right time You believe you can pick winning stocks, but not timing the market You don't believe you can pick winning stocks, but you believe timing the market as a whole is possible You don't believe you can pick winning stocks OR time the market I'm strongly for 4. And this is because: The average investor performs worse than inflation. 3 The professionals don't fare well either.

New information is reflected almost instantaneously in stock prices. If people believe a stock to be worth $100 tomorrow, it will be worth $100 today. There is very little chance you can buy or sell before the whole market beats you to it. Commissions and taxes. These may seem small, but for the active trader trying to beat the market it can add up. 5 The invention of derivatives , a product sensitive to timing and direction, has only served to burn more dollars off investors. In fact, these products were responsible for the 2009 financial crisis. The stock market has always recovered In short, I believe in buying the entire market, aka broad-based, index investing. And the best time for that is, and has always been, now . The Investible Universe Now, before you even make an account, it's important to know what assets you can invest in. And it's not just stocks. Broadly speaking, the types of products available for investment are equities, fixed-income products, real estate, commodities and derivatives. I don't consider insurance products like ILPs or whole life plans as investments 6 . Equities (aka stocks) Cumulative return of the S&P 500, a US market index Stocks represent assets of a company that investors can purchase. Note that in the event of liquidation, bondholders will be paid before shareholders. As a stock-owner, you are entitled to receiving dividends (i.e. when a stock goes 'ex-dividend' ). But what if you want to buy not just a few stocks, but 100? 1000? The entire US market? This is possible with the advent of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) . It is essentially a fund which invests the shareholders' monies into a basket of securities. For example, the SPY tracks the S&P 500, an index tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US. ETFs not only track indices - you can buy ETFs specializing in pharmaceutical products or almost anything else as well. As they are listed on an exchange, ETFs are also subject to regulation 7 . Fixed-Income Securities (aka bonds) Historical Federal Reserve Interest Rates A bond is a loan. By buying a bond, the bearer is obligated to pay you a certain interest rate for the period of the bond (up till the 'maturity date', upon which you receive your initial capital). This is related to the risk of default. Thus, one would expect bonds from governments to pay the least, while those from companies with questionable financial statements to pay more. Bonds can get complicated - there are the vanilla fixed coupon bonds, discount bonds, inflation-protected securities and convertible bonds to name a few. Nontheless, certain basic principles apply. The key risks in buying bonds are interest rate risk 8 (just look at the chart above 9 ) and credit risk. Callable bonds have their own risk - call risk 10 . Historically, during periods of market uncertainty, investors have flocked to bonds as they maintain relative stability compared to equities. Real Estate In the past, the only way to gain exposure to the property sector was to buy physical property in your own name. Now, you can buy property via several property ETFs, some of which are global 11 . Alternatively, one can buy Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), which are companies that own or operate real estate. Local examples include Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust and Ascendas Reit. Commodities Oil prices turn negative for the first time ever on 20 Apr 2020 These refer to physical goods such as corn, soybean, oil and cattle. You can buy gold and silver too - either in the form of ETFs, futures or the actual physical metal. Investing purely in commodities is highly speculative and leveraged, as they trade on margin. You can watch James Cordier of Optionsellers.com's famous apology as an example of what not to do with your clients' money. However, commodities do have a diversification effect when added to a balanced portfolio. For example, gold is known to remain stable or even rise during economic crises. Derivatives Payoff for a strangle on crude oil Derivatives include futures and options, as well as structured products e.g. equity linked notes (ELNs) . There are more exotic products such as Asian options, digital options, options on futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions. These can be combined in complicated ways, such as the strangle 12 shown above. Fundamentally, they derive their value from the movement of some underlying product (hence the term derivative ). I would recommend staying very far from this category if you are a new investor . Unlike stocks or bonds, you can lose (and earn) much more than your initial investment (due to leverage). Now that you know what you can buy, let's see how you can buy. Your Broker A broker is the intermediary company which does the purchasing of the investments for you on an exchange. By and large, most investors do not own shares in their own name - their broker acts as their custodian . This is the only way Singaporeans can buy shares listed in the US or foreign countries. For local shares, you can buy shares in your name with a Central Depository account - which means you get voting rights, invitations to the annual general meetings etc. 13 I recommend sticking with a custodian account, because Fees are cheaper You can invest in overseas markets Assuming you are more interested in the overseas (i.e. US) market 14 , here are some brokers you can consider: Interactive Brokers 15 (I use this) Saxobank TD Ameritrade POEMS (local) DBS Vickers (local) 16 Some factors you may want to consider are: Commissions Custody fees 17 Ease of use Mobile application Products available Investment restrictions 18 Worried about losing your money if the broker goes bust? Fret not: US brokers are protected by the SIPC , up to $500,000 Locally, bank deposits are insured for up to $75,000 19 by the SDIC Epilogue Now that you have your account, it's time to trade! As you progress, you may want to consider reading deeper. Such topics include Asset allocation - how much to invest in stocks/bonds/commodities and why? Trade execution - What is a trailing stop loss? Why is the bid/ask spread so big? What is a liquidity crunch? Derivatives - although I mentioned to avoid them earlier, they make excellent tools for hedging a large equity position. 20 If you haven't already, I recommend you look through some of the investment books I've marked as a general introduction. You'll find my other book recommendations there as well. Finally, if you spot any errors here, do let me know ! I love trading options. Iron condors, calendar spreads, ratio spreads, double diagonals, not just on stocks but on futures, heck, even on volatility itself (the VIX) - I've tried them. I mainly use options for hedging now. \u21a9 Adapted from Asset Allocation, by Roger Gibson \u21a9 JP Morgan's 1Q, 2014 Guide to the Markets \u21a9 A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel \u21a9 'Enough' by John C. Bogle puts forth a poignant argument against the entire brokerage and ETF industry's fees and commissions. \u21a9 I don't consider them investments because insurance is for protection - you shouldn't hope to 'earn' on them. Furthermore, ILPs simply invest in the market but with much higher commissions and caps on profits. You'd be better off just buying the ETFs yourself from a broker. \u21a9 The SEC sets limits on the use of leverage and transactions. ETFs are also required to conform to specific reporting requirements as well as oversight by boards of directors. See here . \u21a9 The risk that when interest rates rise after you buy a bond. This will cause the market value of the bond to decrease. Note however, that if you hold the bond to maturity, you will still receive your initial capital plus interest back. \u21a9 This is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee at which commercial banks charge each other on overnight lending. It is a large driver of other interest rates in general, such as the prime rate . \u21a9 The risk that a bond issuer may choose to buy back the bond prior to maturity, ceasing the stream of interest payments. \u21a9 E.g. iShares Developed Markets Property Yield (DPYA) , which invests in real estate companies and REITS from developed countries. \u21a9 A type of option strategy where one buys an out-of-the-money call and put. Maximum profit is gained when the underlying moves significantly in one direction. \u21a9 See here for a comparison between CDP and custodian accounts. \u21a9 The Straits Times Index has lagged the S&P 500 for decades. See here for other reasons. \u21a9 Commissions are miniscule and the platform allows you to buy almost any product under the sun. The interface may appear a bit intimidating initially but you'll learn to appreciate it. \u21a9 Note the commissions: $25 per trade last I checked. \u21a9 Aka yearly fees for holding your stock. Not all brokers have this. \u21a9 E.g. IB does not allow Singaporeans to buy SGX listed equities. \u21a9 It is a tad disappointing that our local banks have lower bank guarantees than the US. \u21a9 Personally, I use a 1.1 diagonal put ratio spread (1 year long, 3 months short) for hedging my equities (the beta-weighted amount). The Options Edge by Michael C. Khouw provides a great introduction to this hedging strategy. \u21a9","title":"Getting Started with Investing"},{"location":"blog-posts/2020-11-30-getting-started-with-investing/#getting-started-with-investing","text":"Written on 30/11/20 In this post, I give a brief introduction to the world of investments.

Trade execution - What is a trailing stop loss? Why is the bid/ask spread so big? What is a liquidity crunch? Derivatives - although I mentioned to avoid them earlier, they make excellent tools for hedging a large equity position. 20 If you haven't already, I recommend you look through some of the investment books I've marked as a general introduction. You'll find my other book recommendations there as well. Finally, if you spot any errors here, do let me know ! I love trading options. Iron condors, calendar spreads, ratio spreads, double diagonals, not just on stocks but on futures, heck, even on volatility itself (the VIX) - I've tried them. I mainly use options for hedging now. \u21a9 Adapted from Asset Allocation, by Roger Gibson \u21a9 JP Morgan's 1Q, 2014 Guide to the Markets \u21a9 A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel \u21a9 'Enough' by John C. Bogle puts forth a poignant argument against the entire brokerage and ETF industry's fees and commissions. \u21a9 I don't consider them investments because insurance is for protection - you shouldn't hope to 'earn' on them. Furthermore, ILPs simply invest in the market but with much higher commissions and caps on profits. You'd be better off just buying the ETFs yourself from a broker. \u21a9 The SEC sets limits on the use of leverage and transactions. ETFs are also required to conform to specific reporting requirements as well as oversight by boards of directors. See here . \u21a9 The risk that when interest rates rise after you buy a bond. This will cause the market value of the bond to decrease. Note however, that if you hold the bond to maturity, you will still receive your initial capital plus interest back. \u21a9 This is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee at which commercial banks charge each other on overnight lending. It is a large driver of other interest rates in general, such as the prime rate . \u21a9 The risk that a bond issuer may choose to buy back the bond prior to maturity, ceasing the stream of interest payments. \u21a9 E.g. iShares Developed Markets Property Yield (DPYA) , which invests in real estate companies and REITS from developed countries. \u21a9 A type of option strategy where one buys an out-of-the-money call and put.

This number doesn't even begin to include the even larger market of derivatives based on these companies. With so many choices, how do people decide what asset classes to buy, and how many % to allocate to each? Why not just put everything in stocks (e.g. the S&P 500)? To answer this question, we need to understand volatility , risk and diversification . You may also want to read about my investment portfolio . Volatility Intuitively, volatility can be thought of as how much a stock or bond moves during a period (the standard deviation ). Here's a simple visualization. In the chart above (the S&P 500), the average volatility prior to Mar 2020 hovered around 13% 2 . This shot up to a high of 75% during the Coronavirus crisis. Note a few caveats: High volatility per se does not imply a high return and vice versa. A stock which is strongly trending can have a low volatility. This is represented in the first half of the chart above - the S&P climbed from 3,100 to 3,400 in 3 months (a 46% return, annualized) - but volatility remained constant. Conversely, a stock can fluctuate wildly around its average but have high volatility. Exposing yourself to high volatility without corresponding high return is not a good idea. When comparing assets with equal returns, you should prefer the less volatile asset. Risk Investment always involves risk, without exception 4 . Such risk can be broken down as follows: Systemic (market) risk - e.g. COVID-19, the Asian Financial Crisis Sector risk - e.g. the oil industry being affected by a demand drop Company risk - corporate fraud, failed products Credit risk - risk of default Inflation Exchange rate risk Interest rate risk Investors are compensated for taking risk 5 . This is a fundamental principle. Imagine that the government is offering bonds paying 2% p.a. A small startup, XYZ Co., wants to issue bonds to investors to raise capital. Now, unlike the government, XYZ Co. has a risk of defaulting. Therefore, you would only consider buying XYZ Co.'s bonds if the interest rate was higher than 2% (or even more depending on the companies' perceived credit worthiness). This is the reason why corporate bonds pay better than government bonds. Fortunately, some of the risks above can be reduced with diversification. Diversification Diversification means buying products from different classes and sectors to reduce exposure to any single company or risk 6 . When you do so, you can reduce certain classes of risk. Here's an example. If you buy stock from a single company, say Microsoft (MSFT), you are exposed to systemic, sector, company and credit risks. However, if you buy a technology-based ETF e.g. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF ( ARKW ), you are no longer exposed to the risk of a single technological company going bankrupt. You are, however, still exposed to the risk that the technological sector declines 7 . If you want to reduce sector risk, you might decide to buy the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ), an ETF based on the largest 500 companies in the US. Now, you are left with systemic risk, which is non-diversifiable. Diversification also increases return and reduces volatility . One surprising result that I read 3 , was that investors can actually earn more by buying a combination of negatively or poorly correlated volatile investments, as compared to buying just either investment. Here's an example. Investments A and B are two hypothetical assets. They have a simple average return of 10% p.a., but they are both volatile, returning 40% p.a. and -20% p.a. in alternating years. They are also perfectly negatively correlated , meaning that when asset A is rising, asset B is falling and vice versa. After 10 years, the total return is 76%. Now let's introduce investment AB, which is a portfolio consisting of 50% investment A and 50% investment B, rebalanced annually. What do you think the return will be? After 10 years, the total return of the combined portfolio is 159%. This is higher than the constituents. Another thing - the volatility of the combined portfolio is lower than either investment A or B alone. These phenomena occur because during the years where investment A does poorly, rebalancing the portfolio results in a greater proportion of investment A. When investment A subsequently picks up, the portfolio rises as well. This effect is stronger the more negatively correlated the investments are 8 . This is why it isn't a good idea to put 100% of your portfolio in a single asset class (e.g. stocks). In short - diversification increases return, and reduces volatility plus risk , all of which are desirable characteristics of a portfolio. Historical Returns Now that we've reviewed the key concepts of volatility, risk and diversification, let's look at some data. Here are the historical return of various asset classes 9 : Asset Value of $1, invested in 1925 Annualized Return since 1925 Inflation $10.98 3.0% Treasury Bills $18.40 3.7% Long-Term Government Bonds $70.85 5.5% Large Company Stocks $2,657.56 10.4% Small Company Stocks $13,706.15 12.6% Visually 10 : Cumulative real return of asset categories from 1959-2017 A few observations: Treasury bills were a poor long-term investment, with most of the returns eaten away by inflation. This is also the reason why investing purely in bonds is not safe - you will lose to inflation. Equities in general outperformed the other asset classes Although the annualized return for small company stocks was only 2.2% higher than large company stocks, the overall return was 5.15x higher. This illustrates the power of compound interest 11 . Should we invest everything in small company stocks then? No! As mentioned in Diversification , it is important to review the correlations between assets. In this chart 12 , a correlation of 1.00 indicates perfectly positive correlation (meaning that when one asset rises, so does the other and vice versa.) and -1.00 indicates perfectly negative correlation A value of 0 indicates no correlation. Remember, in diversification we want to choose as poorly correlated assets as possible, for the greatest effect. From this chart we can see that Equities and real estate are rather correlated (0.73) Equities were the least correlated to commodities (-0.04) Stocks and bonds were somewhat correlated, more with nongovernment bonds (0.52) than government bonds (0.27) Portfolio Creation Now, we know we have to own equities, bonds, commodities and real estate for the benefits of diversification. But in what percentage? The full answer is mathematically involved. We shall explore it briefly. The chart above 13 plots return against volatility for a porfolio consisting of stocks and bonds 14 . Note that as the composition of the portfolio shifts, the return and volatility change. Initially, return increases while volatility decreases , up to a certain point. That point represents the portfolio with the lowest possible risk - due to diversification. We can run computer simulations 15 on a basket of assets to determine the mathematically optimal allocation. However, the inputs to the computer models - namely expected return and standard deviation, are themselves unknown on a year-by-year basis. Fortunately, the same data has shown that diversified portfolios with different allocations have performed very similarly. In other words, the exact allocation is not important . That being said however, I wouldn't jump into a 100% stock or commodity portfolio. Some observations: Stocks and real estate perform similarly to each other Bonds tend to be the least volatile, compared with equities and commodities Commodities are negatively correlated to equities, but they have had the lowest compound annual return, so you wouldn't want too much in these You must also consider personal factors: Your own risk appetite - what is the maximum drawdown (aka loss at a point in time) you are willing to bear? Are you planning to retire? Your job stability Whether you have dependents and need a large, fixed sum in the future for school fees If you like rules, here are some: Keep your age (in percentage) in bonds, and the rest in stocks (John C. Bogle) Hold no more than 80% of your assets in stocks/equities Conclusion You can see my asset allocation here for ideas. The earlier you start, the faster the magic of compound interest can begin. The road goes ever on and on 16 , and so shall your journey into the world of investing. Nothing worthwhile is ever easy. I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I did writing it.

Uniquely for equities, the Fama-French Three Factor Model posits that the only risk premiums affecting return are: Market-risk premium (investing in stocks) Size premium (investing in small companies, which could go bust easily) Value premium (investing in companies which are 'cheap' relative to their earnings) \u21a9 Technically speaking, one can only reduce diversifiable risk (sector, company, credit risks.)

Such activity, to me, is likely to lead to loss . These are the reasons for my own portfolio allocation above . As I am still working, the bulk return of my portfolio comes from equities. I am comfortable bearing the drawdown risk. For equities, I buy both an ETF investing in large and mid-cap companies globally across both emerging and developed markets (ISAC), and another in small-cap companies, also globally (WSML). I buy some bonds for the diversification effect. As interest rates are low now (2020), I have reduced the allocation to bond ETFs. I plan to increase this as I grow older. I am planning to buy a commodity ETF e.g. one tracking the GSCI . For the portfolio detailed at the start of this post, my risk exposures are 80% equities (of which 50% are large- and mid-cap companies globally, and 30% small-cap) 10% global property (in the form of real estate investment trust ETFs) 10% bonds (international denominated bonds) FAQ Why are all your ETFs dormiciled in Ireland? What does UCITS mean? The main reasons are to save on witholding tax on dividends (15% vs 30%), and estate duty. Bogleheads has a great explanation. Note: this only applies if you're not a US investor. Why not consider high yield, short duration bonds e.g. SDHA ? High yield, short duration bonds perform remarkably similar to equities (they lack the traditional stability associated with bonds). I would rather invest more in equities than in these or junk bonds. Why ISAC + WSML and not IWDA + CSPX or VWRA ? See this post . Why ISAC over VWRA? See this post . Why not IMID ? This includes small to large-cap stocks across developing AND developed markets! See this post . How often to rebalance the portfolio? A very good, mathematically accurate answer I read 2 suggests that you should rebalance at most once a year. That is what I do. In terms of adding cash into the portfolio however, I add once I have a suitable amount, to make the cost of transaction fees minimal. How much can I withdraw a year, without losing all of my principal? 4% of the total portfolio value per annum, assuming a portfolio invested in stocks and bonds 3 . Withdrawing more than 4% p.a. will make the portfolio go to $0 eventually. Should I hedge against foreign currency risk? This is controversial, but essentially if you are looking at the long term, currency hedging has little to no impact on your portfolio. 4 Why not put more into CPF instead? E.g. SA (SA shielding)? The main idea behind using CPF as an investment vehicle ( 1M65 etc) is to reap the 4% p.a. guaranteed return from the SA account. I firmly believe that over the course of a long investment horizon, such as 20 years, investment into the global markets can and will yield much better results than 4% p.a. (about 10% p.a. in fact). $1000 invested at 4% p.a. is worth $2191 in 20 years.

In this post, I go against the common wisdom of 'getting your money back' 1 and refute common arguments for whole life insurance. I propose, and defend, my recommendation to buy term life + critical illness coverage. Of note, a good comparison of insurance policies can be found on comparefirst.sg . Finally, I can check premiums without calling 10 agents Update (Apr 2021) : MoneyOwl is a service which independently assesses policies across insurance companies for you, and rebates you up to 50% of the commission they receive (of what your agent would normally get). Term Life offers the same protection for a lower cost This is the single most important reason. Let's look at the premiums for a 27-year, male non-smoker, sum assured $300,000 2 . For the sake of comparison: there is no 'multiplier' component on the whole life (note: a 'multiplier' is essentially term insurance 3 ) the premium term for the whole life is until 80, for easier comparison with the term life I chose the lower-mid quotes for each on comparefirst.sg Type Annual Premium Premium Term Total Premium Term Life till 75 $540 48 $25,680 Whole Life $4,761 52 $247,572 The term life is nearly 90% cheaper than the whole life, for the same coverage. You can invest the extra $221,892 yourself. Another interesting effect: With inflation, the premiums you pay later on, actually become cheaper 4 . The rational individual should therefore prefer to pay over a longer period of time 7 . Also, some term life policies are convertible , meaning you have the guaranteed option to switch to a whole life policy before a certain age (usually 65). Common Arguments for Whole Life Q: But I will definitely get my money back for the whole life plan! A: Yes, but is it really worth paying 10 times more for that privilege? You could have invested in property, or paid for your children's education with the money you have saved. Don't forget - even if you get your money back, it's already worth less because of inflation 4 . $100 now is worth more than $100 in the future. Q: How about the annual bonuses that the insurance company is offering? 3.75% is a lot! A: Firstly, the bonuses are not guaranteed . Secondly, the bonus rates are significantly lower than what you can get from broad-based index investing - $100 compounded for 10 years at 3.75% is $144.59, while at 8% (US stock historical return) it is $215.89. You'd be better off buying a term life policy and investing the rest yourself. If you don't think you can invest, put it all into CPF. The SA (Special Account) interest of 4%++pa/yr beats nearly all whole life plans in the market. In fact, just by having $130K in CPF by your early 30s, you could have $1,000,000 in CPF by 65 6 . Q: The coverage for term life ends at 75! What happens if I die after that? I get nothing! A: This is one of the biggest misconceptions with insurance. Insurance isn't an investment . It's meant to cover you in the unlikely event a major catastrophe befalls you when you're still building up your nest egg, or when you have dependents. Think about it - if insurance were a surefire way to earn money, how would the insurance companies profit? They're not running a charity. I chose 75 to be the cover end date for the term policy, as that is when you should be financially independent, and no longer have any dependents or liabilities. Which brings me to... Q: If term insurance is so good, why not I buy it till 100? Isn't that a sure-earn? I only need to pay $200K total for $1M coverage! A: Again, insurance isn't an investment . While there are some people pushing it, it is important to note that unlike a traditional investment, you: cannot 'withdraw' money if you need it cannot use the sum assured for collateral (e.g. to buy property) have to continually pay premium, or the policy will lapse If you want to use it for inheritance, fine 5 . Otherwise, stick to a proper investment plan . Other FAQ Q: Are there really no benefits to whole life then? Surely it can't be that bad? A: A whole life policy can be a way for the less disciplined to set aside money each year. Additionally, if you pay over a shorter premium term e.g. 10/15 years, you do not have to pay anything after, unlike the term life. Also, as you will get the sum assured (plus bonuses) upon death, it can be a way to provide inheritance for your children. Of course, the same can be done with term life + an investment strategy. Q: How about critical illness (CI) coverage? Is it worth it? A: Yes. CI coverage covers against cancer, stroke, heart attack and other serious diseases 8 which, if they don't kill you outright, can leave you unable to work. Buying a CI rider will accelerate 10 the sum assured in the event of diagnosis of one of these illnesses, helping to cover you when you are unable to work. Note: This is NOT the same as hospitalization insurance ( shield plans ). Hospitalization insurance pays for the cost of treatment and surgery. After you leave the hospital, you're on your own. CI coverage is to help defray your living costs due to lack of income. Q: Should I buy Early Critical Illness (ECI) cover? A: This is a topic I am currently considering and researching myself. The additional coverage is nice to have considering the standard critical illness definitions are becoming stricter. However, unlike the standard CI definitions, ECI definitions are not standard and vary by insurance company 9 . Nontheless, covering a smaller sum, say $200,000 can be an option. Q: How much insurance should I buy? A: My personal ideology is to cover approximately 10 years of your income, or $1M, whichever is less. Otherwise, you can go with the traditional methods of calculating your assets and liabilities. It is better to over-buy than under-buy (within reason). Q: Shouldn't I wait until I have dependents before buying insurance? A: Premiums are cheaper overall the earlier you buy. For example, for a sum assured of $300,000, if you were to buy term insurance for 50 years (till 75) when you are 25, you would pay $28,425 total in premiums. However, if you were to buy term insurance for 35 years (till 75) when you are 40, you would pay $33,784 total in premiums. Wasn't that the main reason you were going to buy whole life insurance? :) \u21a9 comparefirst.sg \u21a9 Mathematically speaking, a multiplier component on a whole-life policy is equivalent to purchasing an additional term insurance over the same duration. For example, a $100,000 whole life policy with a 2x multiplier up to 75, is equivalent to buying the basic $100,000 whole life policy and then buying another $100,000 term insurance till 75. \u21a9 The median inflation rate for Singapore was 1.72%pa from 1961-2021 ( source ).

However, the expense ratio of ISAC has since dropped to 0.2%, making ISAC more attractive. ISAC includes mid and large-cap emerging market stocks, while the CSPX + IWDA combo does not. Also, ISAC does all this in 1 ETF, instead of 2.

While the ISAC + WSML combo does not include emerging small cap markets, to me this isn't a problem - I think emerging small caps are quite a gamble. That's my opinion. FAQ Why ISAC over VWRA? VWRA is a Vanguard fund dormiciled in Ireland, tracking the FTSE All-World index , an index covering large and mid-cap companies across developed and developing markets which claims to track 98% of the world investible market capitalization. The MSCI ACWI Index on the other hand, tracks 85% of the global investible set. Apart from some other minor differences , the MSCI and FTSE World indices are similar in that they include mid to large-cap stocks in developing and developed countries. I wouldn't fret over the differences too much. If you're already in ISAC, keep it. Otherwise, you can consider buying VWRA to begin with. Why not IMID ? This includes small to large-cap stocks across developing AND developed markets! The main reason is due to the small fund size at the moment (0.27B), and the higher expense ration (0.4%). Otherwise, it is an attractive option, being 1 ETF instead of 2. This is the difference between the price you buy and sell at.

In this case, ?l refers to the set abcde...xyz , and ?d refers to all digits 0-9. -i specifies that we want to progressively try the mask, starting from --increment-min (default 1). What this does is it will try only 1 character of the mask (e.g. a ), then 2, up till --increment-max (default being the length of the mask, e.g. zzzzzzzzzz ). ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 is the mask itself. ?1 refers to the character set in the first position, that we specified above with -1 .

Endowus also rebates trailer fees they receive from funds, so you pay even less. Finally, you can even build your own portfolio, using funds from PIMCO to Dimensional. With that in mind, should you switch from IBKR to Endowus? Endowus Of the robo-advisors in Singapore, Endowus is the only one offering institutional level funds (the rest, such as Syfe or Stashaway , use ETFs). Institutional-level funds may offer lower costs than their retail counterparts. Endowus is also the only way you can access to funds from Dimensional , a world-wide mutual fund company boasting Nobel laureates such as Myron Scholes 1 .

Co-originator of the Black-Scholes options pricing model, used widely for hedging, pricing and speculative purposes in all markets globally. \u21a9 This is the rating for UOB's Long-Term Bank Deposits by Moody's. \u21a9 IBKR's rates for currency exchange are highly competitive . \u21a9 \u21a9 The cost for IBKR includes brokerage commissions, exchange fees, and an estimate of the bid-ask spread. \u21a9","title":"Verdict"},{"location":"blog-posts/2021-07-25-my-endowus-portfolio/","text":"My Endowus Portfolio I recently started an Endowus portfolio ( reasons ).

Secondly, I add exposure to developed small- and mid-cap companies with Dimensional's Global Targeted Value Fund (net expense ratio 0.49% pa).

Lots of recipes on the internet have different variations, some use salt, some involve putting water in the oven as well, and others recommend keeping the raw belly in the refrigerator for 18 hours before putting it in the oven. In this recipe I keep everything to the minimum, so there's as little cleaning/preparation involved, for the same great taste. The belly is first cooked at a low temperature while the skin is further dried in the oven with a layer of salt. It's then roasted at a sizzling 230\u00b0C to bring out the crispiness. The salt is necessary for the skin to have that bubbly, crispy texture. Time required: 2 hours Ingredients Pork belly, skin-on Salt Steps Preheat oven to 140\u00b0C. Layer salt evenly over the skin of the pork belly. Place in the oven for around 30 minutes, or when the internal temperature reaches 62\u00b0C. Take out from oven and remove the layer of salt crust that has formed. Set the oven to 230\u00b0C and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to char.","title":"Crispy Pork Belly Recipe"},{"location":"blog-posts/2021-09-16-crispy-pork-belly/#crispy-pork-belly","text":"Crispy, roasted pork belly is a really nice snack (and main dish).

As a programmer there were a lot of version/environment issues I faced while developing with Python/Node. Some examples: Switching between different Python versions on Windows is difficult and requires third-party solutions e.g. Chocolatey Switching between different Node versions also requires a third-party solution ( nvm ) While pipenv , venv and poetry are ways to manage different Python environments, they still depend on the base Python version installed, which is another external dependency I thought about this issue while deciding on a Python packagement system for Windows , and here is my solution. Docker Containers, in WSL2, in VSCode In a nutshell, my solution is to use VSCode's Remote - Containers extension, to open a folder in WSL2, and then mount that folder in a Docker container. This has several benefits: Ability to lock ALL dependencies for a project, including Python, Node, or Java versions Repeatable builds irregardless of underlying OS (as long as Docker is installed) Host filesystem is not polluted The underlying files are stored in the WSL distro, and can be viewed natively with Explorer via \\\\wsl$ . [NEW]: GPU passthrough is now supported on Windows! The reason why I use the WSL filesystem, and not a bind mount on the Windows filesystem, is for performance . What is WSL? WSL is a compatibility layer which allows Linux binaries to run natively on Windows systems. WSL2 takes this further, and includes a real Linux kernel with full system call capabilities. Installing WSL will allow you to run a complete Linux distribution on your Windows PC (with the wsl command). Getting Started Installing WSL2 and a default distro: Follow the instructions here to install WSL2 and the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu) Next, check that the Ubuntu distribution is set as default, and is on WSL2: wsl -l -v should show: NAME STATE VERSION * Ubuntu Running 2 Legacy Stopped 1 docker-desktop Running 2 docker-desktop-data Running 2 If Ubuntu is missing, install it from the Microsoft Store (you need to run ubuntu from the command prompt after) If Ubuntu is not the default distro (marked with a *), run wsl --set-default Ubuntu . If the VERSION for Ubuntu is not 2 , run wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 . (Advanced) If you want to move the WSL installation to another folder of your choice, you can use the --export followed by the --import commands. Installing Docker and configuring it to use the WSL2 backend: Follow the instructions here Ensure that Enable integration with my default WSL distro , and integration for your distro are both checked. Check that Docker is working: docker ps Setup git in WSL2 VSCode adopts the following behaviors with regards to .gitconfig : If a repository is cloned and opened in a container, the .gitconfig from Windows ( C:\\Users\\<USER>\\.gitconfig ) is copied and used If a WSL2 folder is opened in a container, the .gitconfig from WSL ( ~/.gitconfig ) is copied and used in the container Therefore, since we are opening WSL2 folders in containers, we need to setup git on WSL2 (it's not setup by default). Open up a WSL2 terminal: wsl Set your username: git config --global user.name <USERNAME> Set your email: git config --global user.email <EMAIL> (note, if you have setup email privacy on Github, you will find your email at https://github.com/settings/emails ) If you want to use VSCode as the editor in git , do: git config --global core.editor \"code --wait\" Verify your settings with git config --list That's it. VSCode configures the credential helper automatically for you (by setting up some sort of SSH/GPG agent forwarding ). Opening a WSL2 Folder in a container Follow this guide . Notes: You can modify the .devcontainer/Dockerfile to your liking - e.g. if you want to add Java to a Python image, install package dependencies during build, etc If you want to install requirements automatically e.g. with pip , you can either uncomment that particular line in the Dockerfile (if it exists) or write your own e.g.: COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt RUN pip --no-cache-dir install -r requirements.txt And that's it!
