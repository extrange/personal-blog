Writing at the speed of thought I used to dream about building a device which could record your thoughts. Suppose you were out on a run, and an idea popped into your head. It would be quite inconvenient to stop, take out your phone or pen, and jot down your thoughts - the act of recording interrupts the flow. Imagine instead that you could just think, say 'I want to visit so-and-so', and a pocket-sized device, carried by you, would dutifully record that thought verbatim. It could also add tags, such as a category, much like a note-taking app. This device wouldn't be limited by your writing speed or rate of speech. The barrier would lie not in the device, but in the user - the speed of their thought, the ultimate barrier. Unfortunately, as of the time I am writing this, no such technology exists. The fastest way we can record our thoughts now is by speech recognition technology, since we speak faster than we type. The accuracy is improving steadily. However,unlike typing, speaking offers less in the way of privacy (barring subvocalization). I like typing my thoughts out, especially on a pretty editor with a nice, monospaced font, such as VSCode with JetBrains Mono, which is my current setup. I type in Dvorak as there's more alternation between the left and right hands compared to QWERTY. There's something sublimely satisfying, seeing paragraphs of evenly spaced text fill a blank editor screen, with the squiggles of the autocorrect flashing now and then. On some days, the rain and thunder might be pouring outside, while I fix and commit code, taking care to write each subroutine and function as elegantly as possible, with no unnecessary load on the computer. This strive towards perfection annoyed even myself initially, as I often got stuck on a particular feature for days. However, it soon began to feel sort of like a meditative process, almost Zen-like, where the goal was not in the resolution of the issue, but rather in the journey itself, and the numerous libraries I picked up along the way. To me, coding is about building things and fixing those very same structures. Unlike in the real world, however, one can build anything imaginable in code. Any form of control or automation so desired is attainable, limited only by the laws of logic. Writing a program is like maintaining a garden. The collaborative process in coding is unique to the field. We write programs to automate menial tasks. Later on, we release them to the public domain, where other people build larger programs on top of them, and in turn release them. This eventually culminates in large but polished libraries such as React and Django, or refinements to the languages themselves such as ES6. When you import React from 'react' , destructure a variable with ... or debounce a function, you are calling upon the work of thousands of people who have developed these facilities, sometimes to solve the very same problem you are facing, and almost instantaneously. It is almost as if you are coding with the world at large. My Journey I started out by reading books about computer hacking. Long ago, I borrowed a book on computer security (it was a thick book with a picture of a chessboard). I read about NMAP, TCP/IP, exploits on the IIS server (CodeRed), Windows LANMAN...though I didn't understand much then, I knew I really wanted to learn more about computers. \"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.

Brooks I was interested in computers and IT since I was in primary school. The web was in its infancy then; I still remember using 56kbps dialup. Ironically, most of my interest came about when my parents locked my computer and I had to figure out ways of circumvention (booting Linux, keyloggers...). I learnt about networking from trying to configure the routers in my house mostly by trial and error - those IT people my parents called charged something north of $50 just for tweaking settings like DHCP or DNS and security. The 1999 movie 'The Matrix' was also a big inspiration to me. I read The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defence sometime in the 2000s. It read like a novel, detailing the different methods virus writers would use, and the catch up game antivirus vendors would play. Some of the methods (like polymorphic encryption, virtual machines) used by the virus writers were incredibly complicated, but yet, amazingly, the authors of the book were able to provide a detection heuristic for them. Later on, my portable hard drive, filled with most of my personal data collected over many years, crashed. My diaries, personal notes, photos were gone. That was when I began reading on filesystems ($MFT, streams, MBR/GPT) and data recovery (I couldn't buy EnCase so I made do with dd and a hex editor). Although I wasn't successful in recovering my data, I finally understood how filesystems and their fault tolerance mechanisms worked. This screenshot (20kB) is larger than the program (4kB) I briefly read about x86 assembly and reverse engineering.

Looking deeper, I realized Github was having trouble provisioning the SSL certificate. The solution was to disable Cloudflare proxying . Upon doing so, I was able to get an SSL certificate provisioned for the root domain, nicholaslyz.com . The Problem Cloudflare is one of the largest CDNs, and the Free plan offers unlimited bandwidth to your site. I use it for this site. However, the configuration can be tricky... I kept getting this error for ```www.nicholaslyz.com```, but not ```nicholaslyz.com``` Here was my initial configuration: I use Github Pages with custom domains and 'Enforce HTTPS' enabled, and Cloudflare with SSL Full (Strict) . When a visitor visits www.your-site.com , Github issues a HTTPS 301 redirect from the www subdomain to the registered custom domain/subdomain (in this case your-site.com ), presenting a certificate valid for www.github.com, *.github.com, github.com, *.github.io, github.io, *.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com . This happens because Github only provisions certificates for the registered (sub)domain (in my case, nicholaslyz.com ) and not the other subdomains. Github redirects users automatically to the correct version of your page, using their Github certificate With Cloudflare proxying switched off - Firefox displays 'Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead' for the www version of the site, because the Github certificate is not valid for the www subdomain. This is the same error Cloudflare is getting. Chrome and Edge however, ignore the certificate error , so they follow the redirect and work fine. This configuration (without cloudflare proxying) will still result in an error when the user tries to visit the www subdomain: If Cloudflare proxying is turned off, the error recurs This is because Github is trying to redirect the user to the non- www version of the site while presenting the Github certificate. Solution The following DNS settings worked (changes in red): I believe CF allows requests from the origin with mismatched certificates to pass through if The CNAME entry closest to the origin is being queried or The certificate issued by the origin is valid for the requested hostname, regardless of the intermediate CNAME domains. Here are some examples of this hypothesis. Example 1 - Cloudflare ON Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com example.com Proxied CNAME example.com google.com Proxied www.example.com gives the 526 error (google.com does not have a valid certificate for `www.example.com ) example.com loads google.com (Point 1 above) Example 2 - Cloudflare OFF Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com example.com DNS Only CNAME example.com google.com DNS Only www.example.com gives certificate error on browsers example.com gives certificate error on browsers This is expected browser behavior as the certificates presented by example.com and google.com do not match www.example.com and example.com respectively. Example 3 - Without CNAME flattening Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com subdomain.example.com Proxied CNAME subdomain.example.com google.com Proxied www.example.com gives the 526 error subdomain.example.com loads google.com (Point 1 above) So CNAME flattening is not the cause. Example 4 - Origin presents valid certificate for requested hostname Assume example.github.io has the certificate for ONLY example.com (not its subdomains) Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME example.com subdomain.example.com Proxied CNAME subdomain.example.com example.github.io Proxied example.com loads properly (Point 2 above) subdomain.example.com gives a Github Page not found error This is because Github is receiving a request for the hostname subdomain.example.com which does not have a Github page setup. Cloudflare however, accepts Github's mismatched certificate just fine during the processing of this request. Example 5 - Origin presents invalid certificate for requested hostname Type Name Content Proxy Status CNAME www.example.com subdomain.example.com Proxied CNAME subdomain.example.com example.github.io Proxied www.example.com gives the 526 error (Github does not have the certificate for www.example.com ) subdomain.example.com gives a Github Page not found error (same as above) Many people have had this problem, in fact there is a list of pages affected by the certificate mismatch error. There is also a temporary hack to get Github to provision certificates for both the www and root domains.","title":"Cloudflare and Github Pages"},{"location":"blog-posts/2020-09-24-cloudflare-and-github-pages/#dns-settings-for-serving-github-pages-over-cloudflare","text":"Written on 24/9/20","title":"DNS settings for serving Github Pages over Cloudflare"},{"location":"blog-posts/2020-09-24-cloudflare-and-github-pages/#update-201220-cloudflare-proxying-prevents-ssl-certificate-renewal","text":"When the SSL certificate (provisioned by Github automatically for the custom domain you specified, via Let's Encrypt) expired on 18/12/20, I started getting errors from Cloudflare.

I kept getting this error for ```www.nicholaslyz.com```, but not ```nicholaslyz.com``` Here was my initial configuration: I use Github Pages with custom domains and 'Enforce HTTPS' enabled, and Cloudflare with SSL Full (Strict) . When a visitor visits www.your-site.com , Github issues a HTTPS 301 redirect from the www subdomain to the registered custom domain/subdomain (in this case your-site.com ), presenting a certificate valid for www.github.com, *.github.com, github.com, *.github.io, github.io, *.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com . This happens because Github only provisions certificates for the registered (sub)domain (in my case, nicholaslyz.com ) and not the other subdomains. Github redirects users automatically to the correct version of your page, using their Github certificate With Cloudflare proxying switched off - Firefox displays 'Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead' for the www version of the site, because the Github certificate is not valid for the www subdomain. This is the same error Cloudflare is getting. Chrome and Edge however, ignore the certificate error , so they follow the redirect and work fine.

Broadly speaking, the universe of sweeteners can be divided into low- and zero-calorie sweeteners. These are: Low-calorie sweeteners. Agave syrup (marketed as low GI, but full of fructose!) Sugar Alcohols . These include: Xylitol (100% sweetness of sucrose, and prevents dental caries ) Sorbitol (40-70% sweetness of sucrose) Erythritol (60-80% sweetness of sucrose) Zero-calorie sweeteners.

After leaving the leaves for 24 hours in a food dehydrator, the end result was a crumbly, shrunken mass of leaves. Grinding The next step was to grind the leaves into a powder! I used a metal mortar and pestle, although research suggests that a coffee grinder is better (I don't have one). While grinding I discarded some stems away since they didn't grind well. End Result The final product! This is the result of about ~30 leaves from 3 separate plants in total. The taste can be described as rather sweet, with some earthy undertones. It is much less bitter compared to the raw, fresh leaf. There is another way to extract the stevia using alcohol, but I'll leave that to another day (or just buy it off iHerb). So that's it!

Or wait for the hype to tide over? \"For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\" -Alexander Pope, 1711 Over the last few years I've read investment books, discussed the markets with other speculators, and tried my hand at investing from vanilla stocks, to ETFs (both index and exotic), fixed income (think bonds and T-bills), derivatives including options 1 and futures. I studied technical analysis, from candlestick patterns to resistance/support charting and technical indicators. Sadly, nobody teaches you investing in school (unless you're studying finance). I went the long way round, both chronologically and financially, to learn investing. You don't have to , if you start with the right books and perspectives. Investors can be classified into one of 4 groups 2 : You believe you can pick winning stocks at the right time You believe you can pick winning stocks, but not timing the market You don't believe you can pick winning stocks, but you believe timing the market as a whole is possible You don't believe you can pick winning stocks OR time the market I'm strongly for 4. And this is because: The average investor performs worse than inflation. 3 The professionals don't fare well either. Mutual funds, run by quants on Wall Street, do no better - 7.53% vs the Russell 3000 Index (a broad market index)'s 8.42% return, compared over 20 years. 4 The market is very nearly efficient . New information is reflected almost instantaneously in stock prices. If people believe a stock to be worth $100 tomorrow, it will be worth $100 today. There is very little chance you can buy or sell before the whole market beats you to it. Commissions and taxes. These may seem small, but for the active trader trying to beat the market it can add up. 5 The invention of derivatives , a product sensitive to timing and direction, has only served to burn more dollars off investors. In fact, these products were responsible for the 2009 financial crisis. The stock market has always recovered In short, I believe in buying the entire market, aka broad-based, index investing. And the best time for that is, and has always been, now . The Investible Universe Now, before you even make an account, it's important to know what assets you can invest in. And it's not just stocks. Broadly speaking, the types of products available for investment are equities, fixed-income products, real estate, commodities and derivatives. I don't consider insurance products like ILPs or whole life plans as investments 6 . Equities (aka stocks) Cumulative return of the S&P 500, a US market index Stocks represent assets of a company that investors can purchase. Note that in the event of liquidation, bondholders will be paid before shareholders. As a stock-owner, you are entitled to receiving dividends (i.e. when a stock goes 'ex-dividend' ). But what if you want to buy not just a few stocks, but 100? 1000? The entire US market? This is possible with the advent of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) . It is essentially a fund which invests the shareholders' monies into a basket of securities. For example, the SPY tracks the S&P 500, an index tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US. ETFs not only track indices - you can buy ETFs specializing in pharmaceutical products or almost anything else as well. As they are listed on an exchange, ETFs are also subject to regulation 7 . Fixed-Income Securities (aka bonds) Historical Federal Reserve Interest Rates A bond is a loan. By buying a bond, the bearer is obligated to pay you a certain interest rate for the period of the bond (up till the 'maturity date', upon which you receive your initial capital). This is related to the risk of default. Thus, one would expect bonds from governments to pay the least, while those from companies with questionable financial statements to pay more. Bonds can get complicated - there are the vanilla fixed coupon bonds, discount bonds, inflation-protected securities and convertible bonds to name a few. Nontheless, certain basic principles apply. The key risks in buying bonds are interest rate risk 8 (just look at the chart above 9 ) and credit risk. Callable bonds have their own risk - call risk 10 . Historically, during periods of market uncertainty, investors have flocked to bonds as they maintain relative stability compared to equities. Real Estate In the past, the only way to gain exposure to the property sector was to buy physical property in your own name. Now, you can buy property via several property ETFs, some of which are global 11 . Alternatively, one can buy Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), which are companies that own or operate real estate. Local examples include Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust and Ascendas Reit. Commodities Oil prices turn negative for the first time ever on 20 Apr 2020 These refer to physical goods such as corn, soybean, oil and cattle. You can buy gold and silver too - either in the form of ETFs, futures or the actual physical metal. Investing purely in commodities is highly speculative and leveraged, as they trade on margin. You can watch James Cordier of Optionsellers.com's famous apology as an example of what not to do with your clients' money. However, commodities do have a diversification effect when added to a balanced portfolio. For example, gold is known to remain stable or even rise during economic crises. Derivatives Payoff for a strangle on crude oil Derivatives include futures and options, as well as structured products e.g. equity linked notes (ELNs) . There are more exotic products such as Asian options, digital options, options on futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions. These can be combined in complicated ways, such as the strangle 12 shown above. Fundamentally, they derive their value from the movement of some underlying product (hence the term derivative ). I would recommend staying very far from this category if you are a new investor . Unlike stocks or bonds, you can lose (and earn) much more than your initial investment (due to leverage). Now that you know what you can buy, let's see how you can buy. Your Broker A broker is the intermediary company which does the purchasing of the investments for you on an exchange. By and large, most investors do not own shares in their own name - their broker acts as their custodian . This is the only way Singaporeans can buy shares listed in the US or foreign countries. For local shares, you can buy shares in your name with a Central Depository account - which means you get voting rights, invitations to the annual general meetings etc. 13 I recommend sticking with a custodian account, because Fees are cheaper You can invest in overseas markets Assuming you are more interested in the overseas (i.e. US) market 14 , here are some brokers you can consider: Interactive Brokers 15 (I use this) Saxobank TD Ameritrade POEMS (local) DBS Vickers (local) 16 Some factors you may want to consider are: Commissions Custody fees 17 Ease of use Mobile application Products available Investment restrictions 18 Worried about losing your money if the broker goes bust? Fret not: US brokers are protected by the SIPC , up to $500,000 Locally, bank deposits are insured for up to $75,000 19 by the SDIC Epilogue Now that you have your account, it's time to trade! As you progress, you may want to consider reading deeper. Such topics include Asset allocation - how much to invest in stocks/bonds/commodities and why? Trade execution - What is a trailing stop loss? Why is the bid/ask spread so big? What is a liquidity crunch? Derivatives - although I mentioned to avoid them earlier, they make excellent tools for hedging a large equity position. 20 If you haven't already, I recommend you look through some of the investment books I've marked as a general introduction. You'll find my other book recommendations there as well. Finally, if you spot any errors here, do let me know ! I love trading options. Iron condors, calendar spreads, ratio spreads, double diagonals, not just on stocks but on futures, heck, even on volatility itself (the VIX) - I've tried them. I mainly use options for hedging now. \u21a9 Adapted from Asset Allocation, by Roger Gibson \u21a9 JP Morgan's 1Q, 2014 Guide to the Markets \u21a9 A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel \u21a9 'Enough' by John C. Bogle puts forth a poignant argument against the entire brokerage and ETF industry's fees and commissions. \u21a9 I don't consider them investments because insurance is for protection - you shouldn't hope to 'earn' on them. Furthermore, ILPs simply invest in the market but with much higher commissions and caps on profits. You'd be better off just buying the ETFs yourself from a broker. \u21a9 The SEC sets limits on the use of leverage and transactions. ETFs are also required to conform to specific reporting requirements as well as oversight by boards of directors. See here . \u21a9 The risk that when interest rates rise after you buy a bond. This will cause the market value of the bond to decrease. Note however, that if you hold the bond to maturity, you will still receive your initial capital plus interest back. \u21a9 This is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee at which commercial banks charge each other on overnight lending. It is a large driver of other interest rates in general, such as the prime rate . \u21a9 The risk that a bond issuer may choose to buy back the bond prior to maturity, ceasing the stream of interest payments. \u21a9 E.g. iShares Developed Markets Property Yield (DPYA) , which invests in real estate companies and REITS from developed countries. \u21a9 A type of option strategy where one buys an out-of-the-money call and put. Maximum profit is gained when the underlying moves significantly in one direction. \u21a9 See here for a comparison between CDP and custodian accounts. \u21a9 The Straits Times Index has lagged the S&P 500 for decades. See here for other reasons. \u21a9 Commissions are miniscule and the platform allows you to buy almost any product under the sun. The interface may appear a bit intimidating initially but you'll learn to appreciate it. \u21a9 Note the commissions: $25 per trade last I checked. \u21a9 Aka yearly fees for holding your stock. Not all brokers have this. \u21a9 E.g. IB does not allow Singaporeans to buy SGX listed equities. \u21a9 It is a tad disappointing that our local banks have lower bank guarantees than the US. \u21a9 Personally, I use a 1.1 diagonal put ratio spread (1 year long, 3 months short) for hedging my equities (the beta-weighted amount). The Options Edge by Michael C. Khouw provides a great introduction to this hedging strategy. \u21a9","title":"Getting Started with Investing"},{"location":"blog-posts/2020-11-30-getting-started-with-investing/#getting-started-with-investing","text":"Written on 30/11/20 In this post, I give a brief introduction to the world of investments.

Iron condors, calendar spreads, ratio spreads, double diagonals, not just on stocks but on futures, heck, even on volatility itself (the VIX) - I've tried them. I mainly use options for hedging now. \u21a9 Adapted from Asset Allocation, by Roger Gibson \u21a9 JP Morgan's 1Q, 2014 Guide to the Markets \u21a9 A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel \u21a9 'Enough' by John C. Bogle puts forth a poignant argument against the entire brokerage and ETF industry's fees and commissions. \u21a9 I don't consider them investments because insurance is for protection - you shouldn't hope to 'earn' on them. Furthermore, ILPs simply invest in the market but with much higher commissions and caps on profits. You'd be better off just buying the ETFs yourself from a broker. \u21a9 The SEC sets limits on the use of leverage and transactions. ETFs are also required to conform to specific reporting requirements as well as oversight by boards of directors. See here . \u21a9 The risk that when interest rates rise after you buy a bond. This will cause the market value of the bond to decrease. Note however, that if you hold the bond to maturity, you will still receive your initial capital plus interest back. \u21a9 This is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee at which commercial banks charge each other on overnight lending. It is a large driver of other interest rates in general, such as the prime rate . \u21a9 The risk that a bond issuer may choose to buy back the bond prior to maturity, ceasing the stream of interest payments. \u21a9 E.g. iShares Developed Markets Property Yield (DPYA) , which invests in real estate companies and REITS from developed countries. \u21a9 A type of option strategy where one buys an out-of-the-money call and put. Maximum profit is gained when the underlying moves significantly in one direction. \u21a9 See here for a comparison between CDP and custodian accounts. \u21a9 The Straits Times Index has lagged the S&P 500 for decades. See here for other reasons. \u21a9 Commissions are miniscule and the platform allows you to buy almost any product under the sun. The interface may appear a bit intimidating initially but you'll learn to appreciate it. \u21a9 Note the commissions: $25 per trade last I checked. \u21a9 Aka yearly fees for holding your stock. Not all brokers have this. \u21a9 E.g. IB does not allow Singaporeans to buy SGX listed equities. \u21a9 It is a tad disappointing that our local banks have lower bank guarantees than the US. \u21a9 Personally, I use a 1.1 diagonal put ratio spread (1 year long, 3 months short) for hedging my equities (the beta-weighted amount). The Options Edge by Michael C. Khouw provides a great introduction to this hedging strategy. \u21a9","title":"Epilogue"},{"location":"blog-posts/2020-12-02-asset-allocation/","tags":["Finance"],"text":"Asset Allocation 1 There are approximately 41,000 listed companies around the world. This number doesn't even begin to include the even larger market of derivatives based on these companies. With so many choices, how do people decide what asset classes to buy, and how many % to allocate to each? Why not just put everything in stocks (e.g. the S&P 500)? To answer this question, we need to understand volatility , risk and diversification . You may also want to read about my investment portfolio . Volatility Intuitively, volatility can be thought of as how much a stock or bond moves during a period (the standard deviation ). Here's a simple visualization. In the chart above (the S&P 500), the average volatility prior to Mar 2020 hovered around 13% 2 . This shot up to a high of 75% during the Coronavirus crisis. Note a few caveats: High volatility per se does not imply a high return and vice versa. A stock which is strongly trending can have a low volatility. This is represented in the first half of the chart above - the S&P climbed from 3,100 to 3,400 in 3 months (a 46% return, annualized) - but volatility remained constant. Conversely, a stock can fluctuate wildly around its average but have high volatility. Exposing yourself to high volatility without corresponding high return is not a good idea. When comparing assets with equal returns, you should prefer the less volatile asset. Risk Investment always involves risk, without exception 4 . Such risk can be broken down as follows: Systemic (market) risk - e.g. COVID-19, the Asian Financial Crisis Sector risk - e.g. the oil industry being affected by a demand drop Company risk - corporate fraud, failed products Credit risk - risk of default Inflation Exchange rate risk Interest rate risk Investors are compensated for taking risk 5 . This is a fundamental principle. Imagine that the government is offering bonds paying 2% p.a. A small startup, XYZ Co., wants to issue bonds to investors to raise capital. Now, unlike the government, XYZ Co. has a risk of defaulting. Therefore, you would only consider buying XYZ Co.'s bonds if the interest rate was higher than 2% (or even more depending on the companies' perceived credit worthiness). This is the reason why corporate bonds pay better than government bonds. Fortunately, some of the risks above can be reduced with diversification. Diversification Diversification means buying products from different classes and sectors to reduce exposure to any single company or risk 6 . When you do so, you can reduce certain classes of risk. Here's an example. If you buy stock from a single company, say Microsoft (MSFT), you are exposed to systemic, sector, company and credit risks. However, if you buy a technology-based ETF e.g. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF ( ARKW ), you are no longer exposed to the risk of a single technological company going bankrupt. You are, however, still exposed to the risk that the technological sector declines 7 . If you want to reduce sector risk, you might decide to buy the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ), an ETF based on the largest 500 companies in the US. Now, you are left with systemic risk, which is non-diversifiable. Diversification also increases return and reduces volatility . One surprising result that I read 3 , was that investors can actually earn more by buying a combination of negatively or poorly correlated volatile investments, as compared to buying just either investment. Here's an example. Investments A and B are two hypothetical assets. They have a simple average return of 10% p.a., but they are both volatile, returning 40% p.a. and -20% p.a. in alternating years. They are also perfectly negatively correlated , meaning that when asset A is rising, asset B is falling and vice versa. After 10 years, the total return is 76%. Now let's introduce investment AB, which is a portfolio consisting of 50% investment A and 50% investment B, rebalanced annually. What do you think the return will be? After 10 years, the total return of the combined portfolio is 159%. This is higher than the constituents. Another thing - the volatility of the combined portfolio is lower than either investment A or B alone. These phenomena occur because during the years where investment A does poorly, rebalancing the portfolio results in a greater proportion of investment A. When investment A subsequently picks up, the portfolio rises as well. This effect is stronger the more negatively correlated the investments are 8 . This is why it isn't a good idea to put 100% of your portfolio in a single asset class (e.g. stocks). In short - diversification increases return, and reduces volatility plus risk , all of which are desirable characteristics of a portfolio. Historical Returns Now that we've reviewed the key concepts of volatility, risk and diversification, let's look at some data. Here are the historical return of various asset classes 9 : Asset Value of $1, invested in 1925 Annualized Return since 1925 Inflation $10.98 3.0% Treasury Bills $18.40 3.7% Long-Term Government Bonds $70.85 5.5% Large Company Stocks $2,657.56 10.4% Small Company Stocks $13,706.15 12.6% Visually 10 : Cumulative real return of asset categories from 1959-2017 A few observations: Treasury bills were a poor long-term investment, with most of the returns eaten away by inflation. This is also the reason why investing purely in bonds is not safe - you will lose to inflation. Equities in general outperformed the other asset classes Although the annualized return for small company stocks was only 2.2% higher than large company stocks, the overall return was 5.15x higher. This illustrates the power of compound interest 11 . Should we invest everything in small company stocks then? No! As mentioned in Diversification , it is important to review the correlations between assets. In this chart 12 , a correlation of 1.00 indicates perfectly positive correlation (meaning that when one asset rises, so does the other and vice versa.) and -1.00 indicates perfectly negative correlation A value of 0 indicates no correlation. Remember, in diversification we want to choose as poorly correlated assets as possible, for the greatest effect. From this chart we can see that Equities and real estate are rather correlated (0.73) Equities were the least correlated to commodities (-0.04) Stocks and bonds were somewhat correlated, more with nongovernment bonds (0.52) than government bonds (0.27) Portfolio Creation Now, we know we have to own equities, bonds, commodities and real estate for the benefits of diversification. But in what percentage? The full answer is mathematically involved. We shall explore it briefly. The chart above 13 plots return against volatility for a porfolio consisting of stocks and bonds 14 . Note that as the composition of the portfolio shifts, the return and volatility change. Initially, return increases while volatility decreases , up to a certain point. That point represents the portfolio with the lowest possible risk - due to diversification. We can run computer simulations 15 on a basket of assets to determine the mathematically optimal allocation. However, the inputs to the computer models - namely expected return and standard deviation, are themselves unknown on a year-by-year basis. Fortunately, the same data has shown that diversified portfolios with different allocations have performed very similarly. In other words, the exact allocation is not important . That being said however, I wouldn't jump into a 100% stock or commodity portfolio. Some observations: Stocks and real estate perform similarly to each other Bonds tend to be the least volatile, compared with equities and commodities Commodities are negatively correlated to equities, but they have had the lowest compound annual return, so you wouldn't want too much in these You must also consider personal factors: Your own risk appetite - what is the maximum drawdown (aka loss at a point in time) you are willing to bear? Are you planning to retire? Your job stability Whether you have dependents and need a large, fixed sum in the future for school fees If you like rules, here are some: Keep your age (in percentage) in bonds, and the rest in stocks (John C. Bogle) Hold no more than 80% of your assets in stocks/equities Conclusion You can see my asset allocation here for ideas. The earlier you start, the faster the magic of compound interest can begin. The road goes ever on and on 16 , and so shall your journey into the world of investing. Nothing worthwhile is ever easy. I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I did writing it.

Uniquely for equities, the Fama-French Three Factor Model posits that the only risk premiums affecting return are: Market-risk premium (investing in stocks) Size premium (investing in small companies, which could go bust easily) Value premium (investing in companies which are 'cheap' relative to their earnings) \u21a9 Technically speaking, one can only reduce diversifiable risk (sector, company, credit risks.)

What does UCITS mean? The main reasons are to save on witholding tax on dividends (15% vs 30%), and estate duty. Bogleheads has a great explanation. Note: this only applies if you're not a US investor. Why not consider high yield, short duration bonds e.g. SDHA ? High yield, short duration bonds perform remarkably similar to equities (they lack the traditional stability associated with bonds). I would rather invest more in equities than in these or junk bonds. Why ISAC + WSML and not IWDA + CSPX or VWRA ? See this post . Why ISAC over VWRA? See this post . Why not IMID ? This includes small to large-cap stocks across developing AND developed markets! See this post . How often to rebalance the portfolio? A very good, mathematically accurate answer I read 2 suggests that you should rebalance at most once a year. That is what I do. In terms of adding cash into the portfolio however, I add once I have a suitable amount, to make the cost of transaction fees minimal. How much can I withdraw a year, without losing all of my principal? 4% of the total portfolio value per annum, assuming a portfolio invested in stocks and bonds 3 . Withdrawing more than 4% p.a. will make the portfolio go to $0 eventually. Should I hedge against foreign currency risk? This is controversial, but essentially if you are looking at the long term, currency hedging has little to no impact on your portfolio. 4 Why not put more into CPF instead? E.g. SA (SA shielding)? The main idea behind using CPF as an investment vehicle ( 1M65 etc) is to reap the 4% p.a. guaranteed return from the SA account. I firmly believe that over the course of a long investment horizon, such as 20 years, investment into the global markets can and will yield much better results than 4% p.a. (about 10% p.a. in fact). $1000 invested at 4% p.a. is worth $2191 in 20 years. But with an interest rate of 10% p.a. compounded, you'd have $6727 instead. - That being said, if you have a shorter investment horizon and plan to use your funds soon, investing in the SA (or the RA) could be part of your portfolio. Why is insurance (e.g. whole-life insurance) not part of the portfolio? Insurance is not investment. . The returns from a whole life policy are much lower than even CPF (SA account earns 4% guaranteed interest, while most whole-life plans have a floor interest rate of 2% p.a.). Rather, one buys insurance as a hedge against adverse events which may cause you to need the money earlier, such as disability or illness. For most working adults with dependents, term life insurance is sufficient. If you're wondering why I buy so many ETFs from iShares, it's because they boast one of the lowest expense ratios (an annual fee charged by the ETF managers). Alternative ETF providers include SSGA and Vanguard . \u21a9 From 'The Intelligent Asset Allocator'. Stock returns exhibit autocorrelation (that is, future returns are affected by past returns) over short time periods (e.g. days to months). If you were to rebalance during such a period where the autocorrelation is positive, you would lose money as you would be selling the rising asset too soon. \u21a9 From 'The Intelligent Asset Allocator'. While the real, inflation-adjusted return of your portfolio may be more than 4% p.a., there are years where your portfolio may earn less than this and vice versa. Based on historical data, a withdrawal rate of more than 4% p.a. has quite a high probability of draining the entire portfolio during a string of years with poor returns. With a 4% or lower withdrawal rate, the portfolio theoretically can be sustained nearly indefinitely. Contrast this to CPF ;) \u21a9 The Intelligent Asset Allocator, pg 142. \u21a9","title":"My Investment Portfolio"},{"location":"blog-posts/2021-01-16-my-investment-portfolio/#my-investment-portfolio","text":"This is my current portfolio allocation as of 2/6/21. % Product 1 (Ticker on LSE) 50% iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF (ISAC) 30% iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF (WSML) 10% iShares Developed Markets Property Yield UCITS ETF (DPYA) 10% iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF (AGGU) As I've emphasized throughout this site, I don't pick individual stocks, nor actively trade.

The returns from a whole life policy are much lower than even CPF (SA account earns 4% guaranteed interest, while most whole-life plans have a floor interest rate of 2% p.a.). Rather, one buys insurance as a hedge against adverse events which may cause you to need the money earlier, such as disability or illness. For most working adults with dependents, term life insurance is sufficient.

While the real, inflation-adjusted return of your portfolio may be more than 4% p.a., there are years where your portfolio may earn less than this and vice versa. Based on historical data, a withdrawal rate of more than 4% p.a. has quite a high probability of draining the entire portfolio during a string of years with poor returns.

The rational individual should therefore prefer to pay over a longer period of time 7 . Also, some term life policies are convertible , meaning you have the guaranteed option to switch to a whole life policy before a certain age (usually 65). Common Arguments for Whole Life Q: But I will definitely get my money back for the whole life plan! A: Yes, but is it really worth paying 10 times more for that privilege? You could have invested in property, or paid for your children's education with the money you have saved. Don't forget - even if you get your money back, it's already worth less because of inflation 4 . $100 now is worth more than $100 in the future. Q: How about the annual bonuses that the insurance company is offering? 3.75% is a lot! A: Firstly, the bonuses are not guaranteed . Secondly, the bonus rates are significantly lower than what you can get from broad-based index investing - $100 compounded for 10 years at 3.75% is $144.59, while at 8% (US stock historical return) it is $215.89. You'd be better off buying a term life policy and investing the rest yourself. If you don't think you can invest, put it all into CPF. The SA (Special Account) interest of 4%++pa/yr beats nearly all whole life plans in the market. In fact, just by having $130K in CPF by your early 30s, you could have $1,000,000 in CPF by 65 6 . Q: The coverage for term life ends at 75! What happens if I die after that? I get nothing! A: This is one of the biggest misconceptions with insurance. Insurance isn't an investment . It's meant to cover you in the unlikely event a major catastrophe befalls you when you're still building up your nest egg, or when you have dependents. Think about it - if insurance were a surefire way to earn money, how would the insurance companies profit? They're not running a charity. I chose 75 to be the cover end date for the term policy, as that is when you should be financially independent, and no longer have any dependents or liabilities. Which brings me to... Q: If term insurance is so good, why not I buy it till 100? Isn't that a sure-earn? I only need to pay $200K total for $1M coverage! A: Again, insurance isn't an investment . While there are some people pushing it, it is important to note that unlike a traditional investment, you: cannot 'withdraw' money if you need it cannot use the sum assured for collateral (e.g. to buy property) have to continually pay premium, or the policy will lapse If you want to use it for inheritance, fine 5 . Otherwise, stick to a proper investment plan . Other FAQ Q: Are there really no benefits to whole life then? Surely it can't be that bad? A: A whole life policy can be a way for the less disciplined to set aside money each year. Additionally, if you pay over a shorter premium term e.g. 10/15 years, you do not have to pay anything after, unlike the term life. Also, as you will get the sum assured (plus bonuses) upon death, it can be a way to provide inheritance for your children. Of course, the same can be done with term life + an investment strategy. Q: How about critical illness (CI) coverage? Is it worth it? A: Yes. CI coverage covers against cancer, stroke, heart attack and other serious diseases 8 which, if they don't kill you outright, can leave you unable to work. Buying a CI rider will accelerate 10 the sum assured in the event of diagnosis of one of these illnesses, helping to cover you when you are unable to work. Note: This is NOT the same as hospitalization insurance ( shield plans ). Hospitalization insurance pays for the cost of treatment and surgery. After you leave the hospital, you're on your own. CI coverage is to help defray your living costs due to lack of income. Q: Should I buy Early Critical Illness (ECI) cover? A: This is a topic I am currently considering and researching myself. The additional coverage is nice to have considering the standard critical illness definitions are becoming stricter. However, unlike the standard CI definitions, ECI definitions are not standard and vary by insurance company 9 . Nontheless, covering a smaller sum, say $200,000 can be an option. Q: How much insurance should I buy? A: My personal ideology is to cover approximately 10 years of your income, or $1M, whichever is less. Otherwise, you can go with the traditional methods of calculating your assets and liabilities. It is better to over-buy than under-buy (within reason). Q: Shouldn't I wait until I have dependents before buying insurance? A: Premiums are cheaper overall the earlier you buy. For example, for a sum assured of $300,000, if you were to buy term insurance for 50 years (till 75) when you are 25, you would pay $28,425 total in premiums. However, if you were to buy term insurance for 35 years (till 75) when you are 40, you would pay $33,784 total in premiums. Wasn't that the main reason you were going to buy whole life insurance? :) \u21a9 comparefirst.sg \u21a9 Mathematically speaking, a multiplier component on a whole-life policy is equivalent to purchasing an additional term insurance over the same duration. For example, a $100,000 whole life policy with a 2x multiplier up to 75, is equivalent to buying the basic $100,000 whole life policy and then buying another $100,000 term insurance till 75. \u21a9 The median inflation rate for Singapore was 1.72%pa from 1961-2021 ( source ).

The quintessential word we hear when evaluating a fund, looking at our CPF, or even when buying insurance (ill-advised). How do we actually calculate the return of our portfolio, when we add/withdraw funds from it over the course of time? Let's consider an example. On 1 Jan 2020, John invests $100. In Jun, the market went up and his portfolio is now worth $200. He invests another $100. By the next year, on 1 Jan 2021, the markets remained flat - leaving him with $300 in his account. What is his return? Surely, his return is not $300 - $100 = $200 (200%), because he invested $200 in total. Neither does it seem to be $300 - $200 = $100 (50%) - it is clear that between Jan 20 and Jun, he made a 100% return ($100 -> $200) We know therefore his return should be between 50-200%, but what is it?

The quintessential word we hear when evaluating a fund, looking at our CPF, or even when buying insurance (ill-advised). How do we actually calculate the return of our portfolio, when we add/withdraw funds from it over the course of time? Let's consider an example. On 1 Jan 2020, John invests $100. In Jun, the market went up and his portfolio is now worth $200. He invests another $100. By the next year, on 1 Jan 2021, the markets remained flat - leaving him with $300 in his account. What is his return? Surely, his return is not $300 - $100 = $200 (200%), because he invested $200 in total. Neither does it seem to be $300 - $200 = $100 (50%) - it is clear that between Jan 20 and Jun, he made a 100% return ($100 -> $200) We know therefore his return should be between 50-200%, but what is it?

Apart from some other minor differences , the MSCI and FTSE World indices are similar in that they include mid to large-cap stocks in developing and developed countries. I wouldn't fret over the differences too much. If you're already in ISAC, keep it. Otherwise, you can consider buying VWRA to begin with. Why not IMID ? This includes small to large-cap stocks across developing AND developed markets! The main reason is due to the small fund size at the moment (0.27B), and the higher expense ration (0.4%).

Endowus has been making waves in the robo-advisor market in Singapore, hitting $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) recently. It offers tailored investment solutions, customized for your risk appetite. Its portfolios are constructed from institutional-level fund classes, so fees are lower. Endowus also rebates trailer fees they receive from funds, so you pay even less. Finally, you can even build your own portfolio, using funds from PIMCO to Dimensional. With that in mind, should you switch from IBKR to Endowus? Endowus Of the robo-advisors in Singapore, Endowus is the only one offering institutional level funds (the rest, such as Syfe or Stashaway , use ETFs). Institutional-level funds may offer lower costs than their retail counterparts. Endowus is also the only way you can access to funds from Dimensional , a world-wide mutual fund company boasting Nobel laureates such as Myron Scholes 1 . Most of the Dimensional funds are based off broad indexes such as the MSCI World Index, the ACWI or the AGGU (for fixed income). Endowus also offers Cash Smart , their version of fixed deposit, with varying levels of risk and returns up to 2% pa. There are also no currency conversion fees with Endowus - all their funds are denominated in SGD. Presumably, the conversion to USD happens within the fund internally and is charged in the net expense ratio, but even that is low (Endowus' fund's expense ratios are ~0.5% pa). Instead, what Endowus charges is an access fee , ranging from 0.25% - 0.6% pa, charged quarterly. This is comparable to the 0.4% - 0.65% pa charged by Syfe , the 0.2 - 0.8% charged by Stashaway and the 0.3 - 0.5% pa charged by Kristal . Interactive Brokers Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is the largest electronic trading platform in the US. In June 2021, they managed $363.5 billion in assets, with over 2,471,000 trades executed daily. Unlike Endowus, which is at heart a robo-advisor, IBKR is a fully featured broker, giving you access to stocks, ETFs, futures, currency, derivatives and more, across global markets. The commissions IBKR charges are highly competitive and are one of the lowest in the market. There is even a commission-free account, which is sadly unavailable in Singapore. IBKR also recently slashed its monthly inactivity fees - there are now no annual or monthly charges to use the platform. You therefore only pay on each trade (the bid-ask spread + commissions + exchange fees). With this flexibility however, comes some drawbacks: You must convert currency yourself (although the rates are one of the best 3 ) You must decide which securities to purchase Rebalancing must be done by yourself A maximum of 1 free withdrawal a month, with fees charged subsequently Comparison Let's summarize the information above: Endowus IBKR Type Robo-Advisor Fully-featured Broker Founded 2017 1978 AUM $1bn $363.5bn What you can buy Institional-Level, SGD Denominated funds Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, derivatives Annual Fees 0.25 - 0.6% None Transaction Fees None Commission + Exchange Fee + Bid/Ask Spread Rebalancing Automatic, free Manual Currency Conversion N/A Manual 3 Custodian UOB Kay Hian (trust account in your name) IB LLC Custodian Bond Rating Aa1 (Moody's) 2 BBB+ (S&P) Withdrawals Free 1 free a month, subsequent charged ~USD $10 Here is what you pay per year, assuming you invest 25% of the amount each quarter, until you reach the full amount by the end of the year 4 .

But as you invest more, IBKR's pricing becomes more attractive. Note that for IBKR, for small amounts, buying more stocks costs more. For large amounts however, the price is essentially identical. Endowus' fees are the same, regardless of how many individual funds you purchase. Verdict With all this in mind, which is better - Endowus or IBKR? Personally, I would go with Endowus for small amounts up to $500,000. Although I pay more fees, I think of this as a convenience factor for: being able to invest in Dimensional automatic rebalancing no currency conversion required For larger amounts above $500,000, the difference in commissions becomes significant (about $3,000 starting from $1M in assets). In that scenario, taking the time to DIY your portfolio in IBKR makes more sense. For ideas on what to buy, check out my suggestions for IBKR and Endowus .

As a programmer there were a lot of version/environment issues I faced while developing with Python, Node and other tools. Some examples: Switching between different Python versions on Windows is difficult and requires third-party solutions e.g. Chocolatey Switching between different Node versions also requires a third-party solution ( nvm ) While pipenv , venv and poetry are ways to manage different Python environments, they still depend on the base Python version installed, which is another external dependency Maintaining other dependencies such as CUDA drivers, ffmpeg etc. I thought about this issue while deciding on a Python packagement system for Windows , and here is my solution. Docker Containers, in WSL2, in VSCode In a nutshell, my solution is to use VSCode's Remote - Containers extension, to open a folder in WSL2, and then mount that folder in a Docker container. This has several benefits: Ability to lock environments for a project, such as Python, Node, or even Java versions Repeatable builds , irregardless of the host OS/drivers Host filesystem only contains source code and nothing else Containers on the host can be accessed remotely over SSH - the only tools required on the remote computer are SSH and VSCode Some notes: Source code is stored in the WSL distro, and can be viewed natively in Windows Explorer via the network share \\\\wsl$ . GPU passthrough is supported since Windows 10 version 21H2. The reason why I use the WSL filesystem, and not a bind mount on the Windows filesystem, is for performance . What is WSL? WSL is a compatibility layer which allows Linux binaries to run natively on Windows systems. WSL2 takes this further, and includes a real Linux kernel with full system call capabilities. Installing WSL will allow you to run a complete Linux distribution on your Windows PC (with the wsl command). Getting Started Installing WSL2 and a default distro: Follow the instructions here to install WSL2 and the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu) Next, check that the Ubuntu distribution is set as default, and is on WSL2: wsl -l -v should show: NAME STATE VERSION * Ubuntu Running 2 Legacy Stopped 1 docker-desktop Running 2 docker-desktop-data Running 2 If Ubuntu is missing, install it from the Microsoft Store (you need to run ubuntu from the command prompt after) If Ubuntu is not the default distro (marked with a *), run wsl --set-default Ubuntu . If the VERSION for Ubuntu is not 2 , run wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 . (Advanced) If you want to move the WSL installation to another folder of your choice, you can use the --export followed by the --import commands. Installing Docker and configuring it to use the WSL2 backend: Follow the instructions here Ensure that Enable integration with my default WSL distro , and integration for your distro are both checked. Check that Docker is working: docker ps Setup git in WSL2 VSCode adopts the following behaviors with regards to .gitconfig : If a repository is cloned and opened in a container, the .gitconfig from Windows ( C:\\Users\\<USER>\\.gitconfig ) is copied and used If a WSL2 folder is opened in a container, the .gitconfig from WSL ( ~/.gitconfig ) is copied and used in the container Therefore, since we are opening WSL2 folders in containers, we need to setup git on WSL2 (it's not setup by default). Open up a WSL2 terminal: wsl Set your username: git config --global user.name <USERNAME> Set your email: git config --global user.email <EMAIL> (note, if you have setup email privacy on Github, you will find your email at https://github.com/settings/emails ) If you want to use VSCode as the editor in git , do: git config --global core.editor \"code --wait\" Verify your settings with git config --list That's it. VSCode configures the credential helper automatically for you (by setting up some sort of SSH/GPG agent forwarding ). Opening a WSL2 Folder in a container Follow this guide . Notes: You can modify the .devcontainer/Dockerfile to your liking - e.g. if you want to add Java to a Python image, install package dependencies during build, etc If you want to install requirements automatically e.g. with pip , you can either uncomment that particular line in the Dockerfile (if it exists) or write your own e.g.: COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt RUN pip --no-cache-dir install -r requirements.txt [Optional] GPU Passthrough If you would like to use your Nvidia GPU in a container, you need to ensure: The container has the Nvidia GPU drivers installed CUDA is installed in the container Using a prebuilt image e.g. pytorch/pytorch will include all these requirements.

We stayed at Club Med St. Moritz . It was full-board and inclusive of ski passes, lessons and rental (of the ski, helmet, boots and poles), which made planning convenient. They also had two-way airport pickup. View from the room The accomodation was somewhat spartan but otherwise all the facilities expected of a 4/5-star hotel including a radiator. The food was Club Med buffet-style from breakfast to dinner, and one of the days there was an opportunity to try cheese and chocolate fondue. As we were there over Christmas there was also a special Christmas buffet dinner which included swordfish sashimi, whole scallops, foie gras and deer meat stew. I did not have any gastrointestinal distress throughout this trip. Of note there was also a bar with free flow drinks all day. While the wine selection was limited (either plain red or white), cocktails and my personal favourite Bailey's Irish Cream were available. Now, about the skiing. We started at the nursery slope at the back of our hotel for the first day, and then on the afternoon of the second day we went up to Corviglia. Map of Corviglia region Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact location of the slopes we did on this map, nor which cablecar we took. I will update this post when I have the information. I had some prior ski experience, having previously tried skiing in Norway alone without a teacher. We joined the beginner group (group 1). I managed to pick up the snow plough turn on the second day of class, and by the fourth day I was quite confident of my parallel turning (better on turning left than right). I was happy by the end of my trip I managed to overcome the paranoia/semi-PTSD I had previously from going down steep slopes at high speed and not being able to stop. Some of the main pointers I felt were helpful: Leaning forward; if not, the skis will not turn easily Putting one's weight on the outside ski when turning Youtube has lots of helpful videos The guide left us alone quite a lot of the time as there were some students who needed a lot of guidance. Most of the slopes here at St Moritz were blue (intermediate), with only one nursery slope just beside our hotel and another on the mountain. This meant most of us were thrown on a blue slope pretty early on, and we all fell a lot (fortunately no serious injuries). Some scenery on the way up Nursery slope A blue (intermediate) slope Regarding the topic of safety, I did not at any time feel my life was in danger, even during periods where I was out of the instructor's sight. While there were some obvious dropoffs, there were too far off from the main slopes to pose any real danger. My main worry was getting an ACL tear 1 ; fortunately this did not happen and the worst injury I got was a right toenail avulsion, likely due to not tightening the top half of the skiing boot sufficiently. It should be tight enough such that leaning with knees forward does not allow the toe to come into contact with the front of the boot. The VTL flight back was rather uneventful and my ART was checked at the departure airport, who knew about the process. Overall, I found the facilities and skiing to be enjoyable. I plan to attempt skiing somewhere closer to home next - perhaps in Japan 2 , when flights resume. While modern ski bindings have drastically reduced the rates of long bone fractures, ligament injuries have increased, probably as the ski binding is not designed to release in response to torsional forces. \u21a9 Skiing, followed by a hot onsen bath, yakitori and sushi. \u21a9","title":"Skiing at St Moritz, Switzerland"},{"location":"blog-posts/2021-12-25-skiing-switzerland/#skiing-in-st-moritz-switzerland","text":"Club Med St. Moritz I went here during December, 2021, on the VTL lane.

Some of the main pointers I felt were helpful: Leaning forward; if not, the skis will not turn easily Putting one's weight on the outside ski when turning Youtube has lots of helpful videos The guide left us alone quite a lot of the time as there were some students who needed a lot of guidance. Most of the slopes here at St Moritz were blue (intermediate), with only one nursery slope just beside our hotel and another on the mountain. This meant most of us were thrown on a blue slope pretty early on, and we all fell a lot (fortunately no serious injuries). Some scenery on the way up Nursery slope A blue (intermediate) slope Regarding the topic of safety, I did not at any time feel my life was in danger, even during periods where I was out of the instructor's sight. While there were some obvious dropoffs, there were too far off from the main slopes to pose any real danger. My main worry was getting an ACL tear 1 ; fortunately this did not happen and the worst injury I got was a right toenail avulsion, likely due to not tightening the top half of the skiing boot sufficiently. It should be tight enough such that leaning with knees forward does not allow the toe to come into contact with the front of the boot. The VTL flight back was rather uneventful and my ART was checked at the departure airport, who knew about the process. Overall, I found the facilities and skiing to be enjoyable. I plan to attempt skiing somewhere closer to home next - perhaps in Japan 2 , when flights resume. While modern ski bindings have drastically reduced the rates of long bone fractures, ligament injuries have increased, probably as the ski binding is not designed to release in response to torsional forces. \u21a9 Skiing, followed by a hot onsen bath, yakitori and sushi. \u21a9","title":"Skiing in St Moritz, Switzerland"},{"location":"blog-posts/2021-12-30-npm-update-behavior/","tags":["Programming"],"text":"npm update does not write updated versions to package.json Update: This issue has been fixed in npm 8.3.2 .

All of us want some form of respect and the feeling of companionship. We want to help others, and feel that others care for us. We read something online or hear some juicy gossip, recall that it vaguely fits someone's interest, and send it to them, hoping that it might help them or pique their interest.

Combined together, these channels of information and communication provide us with an unending stream of distraction, and it is all too easy to fall in and get swept by the current, losing our original destination in the process. The Solution The book Deep Work suggests there are three ways around this quandary, all of which involve setting aside time to work in a quiet area, free from distractions. The first way involves taking a prolonged, continuous period of time off work each year, the second involves setting aside a day or two each week, and the third involves setting aside a scheduled amount of time each day. I think all three have their merits, in part due to the constraints imposed on us by our jobs - it might be hard to take leave on consecutive days, for example. The third method is what I currently use. I find myself to be most productive after dinner, so I set aside time most days at night to my projects. I have developed a sort of routine for my day over the years, as follows: Just before leaving work, I check through my emails, messages and other channels to make sure there is nothing I haven't attended to. For each unattended task/unanswered message I ask myself: Can I respond to this tomorrow? If so, I leave it till the next morning. Once I'm satisfied, I set my phone to silent mode. I don't check my phone after this point, unless I get a call. Depending on my schedule, I exercise. After dinner, I begin working on my tasks sequentially. The next day at lunch, I set aside some time to respond to queries on my phone, before starting work. When I first began this schedule a few years back, I was worried about the impact to my social life it might cause, especially with regards to instant messaging. Would I appear cold or uninterested? Would it seem like I didn't care? To my surprise, the opposite happened. Instead of having shallow, quick back and forth conversations, I found that putting thought into my replies stimulated their interest and revealed deeper subjects they were interested to talk about, and the conversations became much deeper as a result, sometimes blossoming into side projects.

In addition, it allows for capabilities such as port tunneling 1 , file transfers and screen forwarding. The main reasons for setting up SSH access on my machine were to allow me to: Access the filesystem remotely and transfer files Develop on VSCode remotely, in Remote-Containers Tunnel ports to/from the remote machine (e.g., to access local applications only listening on localhost ) SSH Authentication Methods SSH supports several authentication methods , but the most common are: password : Login using the password of the host user. Most common, but vulnerable to password guessing attacks such as brute-force or dictionary-based methods. publickey : Utilizes public key authentication. Effectively resistant 2 to any form of password guessing attack. This mode also allows for the use of certificates , and is the mode we will be using. Certificates What are certificates? Public key (aka asymmetric) encryption consists of a pair of keys - the private and public key. Any information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key (and vice-versa). Public keys are shared publicly as the name suggests, while the private key is kept secret. This can be used to create a digital signature , an electronic variant of the handwritten signature, with similar properties: Authentication : Proves that a message was sent by the signer and no one else. Non-repudiation : Someone who has signed a message, cannot later deny they have done so. In addition, a digital signature offers another property which handwritten signatures lack: Integrity : Any alteration to the signed message renders the signature invalid. This brings us to the topic of certificates ( public key certificates ). These are electronic documents which prove that the owner's public key has been verified by some authority (the certificate issuer). This lets us trust the public keys of unknown entities, provided we trust the certificate issuer. In fact, this is how website certificates are issued under TLS , the cryptographic protocol powering HTTPS. SSH Certificates SSH certificates are essentially public SSH keys signed by some authority's private key, and allow the host to authenticate clients. When a client tries to connect to an SSH host, the client proves its identity by showing the host its public key certificate, which is signed by an authority the host trusts. Unlike TLS however, there are no authorities trusted by default (aka root certificate authorities ). The trusted certificate authority on the host must be set by the user. An advantage of using certificates is that all clients with public keys signed by an authority trusted by the host are automatically granted access, and there is no need to add or maintain the client's public keys in the authorized_keys file on the host. 1. Setting up SSH on the host First, ensure that OpenSSH, the open-source implementation of the SSH protocol and its tools, is installed . To check that sshd , the SSH daemon, is running on the host, open a Powershell terminal as an administrator and execute Get-Service sshd . The output should be similar to the following: Status Name DisplayName ------ ---- ----------- Running sshd OpenSSH SSH Server Next, we will use ssh-keygen to generate our server's public-private key pair, which will be used to sign the public keys of clients we want to allow SSH access from. This keypair is different from the host's keypair (the keypair presented to clients), which is usually stored in %ProgramData%\\ssh\\sshd_config . Open a terminal and type the following: ssh-keygen -f user_ca -t ed25519 -f : the name of the keypair -t : the key algorithm, in this case EdDSA with Curve25519 The passphrase is used to encrypt the private key, and is optional. You should get the following output: Generating public/private ed25519 key pair. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in user_ca. Your public key has been saved in user_ca.pub. The key fingerprint is: SHA256:OxXXnTRmRiD7bxGMgyuU4fz4JTxKcEpGrngbIWpz/ow nick@Desktop-Nick The key's randomart image is: +--[ED25519 256]--+ | . . . .oB | | o o o +.B.o| | . . = *.o.o.+.| | . o = = +oo . .| | + o + .S+.* o . | |. + . o .o+ + . .| | . . o. . o | | + . . | | E o | +----[SHA256]-----+ user_ca contains the private key of this pair, and must be kept secret. Now, we need to tell our host to trust this public key, and enable public key authentication. Open up C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\sshd_config and make the following changes: Set PubkeyAuthentication to yes Set TrustedUserCAKeys to the location of the user_ca.pub file generated above (note, use the full path to eliminate ambiguity) (optional but recommended) Disable password authentication: set PasswordAuthentication to no Now, the host is ready to accept connections from clients whose public keys were signed by this private key ( user_ca above). 2. Signing a client's SSH public key We'll now sign a client's public key, using ssh-keygen . To make things a bit simpler, we'll generate the client's keypair on the host, sign it, and then return the signed keypair to the client. First, we generate a keypair on the host: ssh-keygen -f client_key -t ed25519 Next, we use ssh-keygen to sign the client's public key ( client_key.pub ), with the private key of the keypair we generated earlier ( user_ca ). (Note: if you have added the private key to ssh-agent , see below . ssh-keygen -s user_ca -I <client_name> -n <usernames> -V +1d client_key.pub If you get an error about the public key not being found, use the absolute path to the user_ca.pub file instead, or ensure you run the command from the same directory as the user_ca.pub file. -s : Indicates we want to sign a public key, with the provided private key. -I : Key identifier, usually the name of the client. Will appear in logs. -n : Comma-separated list of usernames (on the host, not WSL) which the client is allowed to log into the host as. Usernames must already exist on the host. Also known as 'principals'. If this option is omitted, the client will not be able to login. -V : Validity interval of the certificate. If omitted, the certificate will be valid forever. Then, copy the files client_key (private key), client_key.pub (public key) and client_key-cert.pub (signed public key) to the client 4 . Usually, these files are placed in %UserProfile%\\.ssh . 3. Login Now, test the SSH login from the client! ssh -i <PATH_TO_KEYFILE> you@your.domain.name where <PATH_TO_KEYFILE> is the location to the private key, e.g. ~\\.ssh\\client_key . You should not be prompted for a password. If you don't want to keep having to specify the keyfile, create/edit the config file (usually at ~/.ssh/config ) 5 : Host ssh.your-domain.com HostName ssh.your-domain.com User your-username IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_private_key (Optional) Adding the private key and signed public key to ssh-agent ssh-agent is a program which is able to store private keys and the signed public key using the appropriate secure credential storage for the operating system. This presents a more secure alternative than storing the private key unencrypted on the server. In order to add keys to the agent, use ssh-add : ssh-add <keyfile> <keyfile> is the location of the private key, e.g. user_ca . To check the keys which have been added to the agent, run ssh-add -l . From now on, ssh-agent will automatically supply the signed public key and private key in commands such as ssh . 6 (Only on Windows) Note: (On the host) If you added the host's certificate signing private key (e.g. user_ca ) to ssh-agent , when you want to sign a client`s public key, you need to use the following command instead: ssh-keygen -Us user_ca -I <client_name> -n <usernames> -V +1d client_key.pub -U indicates the private key should be extracted from ssh-agent . (Optional) Host Public Key Verification over DNS How does the client authenticate the host the first time round? How does the client know that the public key the host is presenting really is the correct key, and not an attacker's key? One way would be to verify the host's key fingerprint manually when connecting the first time. This is known as trust on first use . # ssh server@server.com The authenticity of host 'server@server.com (192.168.65.2)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:e3eMAe6IrkZkWfCnYasBJUNRyHDC8SzDI0gLP9wWf1A. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? However, it's not easy to remember. A better way is to add the host key to the DNS record, in a special type of record called SSHFP . We can get the required information to add via ssh-keygen : C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>ssh-keygen -r your.domain.name your.domain.name IN SSHFP 4 1 3e35102ba1ef8777b74d257edcef0d6391cb9c19 your.domain.name IN SSHFP 4 2 f9212b988c5cb2e9027746b13339c6b32d9f1c49183620765476ba76b51ddd31 You need to add this information as an SSHFP record via your DNS registrar. Finally, on the client, when we connect, we use the following command (non case-sensitive): ssh -o \"VerifyHostKeyDNS ask\" you@your.domain.name The authenticity of host 'your.domain.name (xx.xx.xx.xx)' can't be established. ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+SErmIxcsukCd0axMznGsy2fHEkYNiB2VHa6drUd3TE. Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Sadly, the OpenSSH client in Windows does not support VerifyHostKeyDNS . Why not host your own SSH-CA? Prior to my decision to use ssh-keygen as the certificate authority, I considered a number of alternative self-hosted SSH certificate authorities, but rejected them as follows: Bastillion - Not certificate based. Also, need to manually upload and download the public keys and configure SSH. Cloudflare Tunnel - Need to download on both server and client. I had some issues setting up SSH certificate login. Step - Need to download on both server and client. Also, TLS connection to step-ca from a client requires adding its generated root certificate as a trusted certificate 3 . Teleport - Need to download on both server and client. Teleport Nodes (the server component) are not supported on Windows. The ability to record SSH sessions might be useful if I were to move to Linux. Vault by HashiCorp - Need to download on both server and client. Instead, to streamline the process of generating client certificates, I plan to write a certificate provisioning server which will probably rely on the (already-existing) 2FA login my web app backend uses. This would call ssh-keygen and return the signed public/private key pair. You could use this to bypass firewalls, by running a SOCKS proxy over the tunnel. \u21a9 RSA, EdDSA and Ed25519 are considered secure . DSA (and ECDSA, which uses DSA in a different mathematical group, namely elliptic curves) are susceptible to key recovery attacks when the nonce is reused/predictable. \u21a9 This is because publicly trusted CAs only issue leaf certificates , which cannot be used to sign other certificates. \u21a9 On Linux, the private key must have chmod 600 permissions (i.e. no read access to anyone other than the user), otherwise ssh-add will refuse to add the key. \u21a9 Unfortunately, Windows does not generate the config file automatically on connecting to a host, unlike Linux. You'll have to create it yourself. \u21a9 On Windows, you may now safely delete the private key and the signed public key, as it is stored encrypted in the registry . \u21a9","title":"SSH with Certificates"},{"location":"blog-posts/2022-02-07-ssh-with-certificates/#setup-ssh-with-certificates-on-windows-and-a-bit-of-linux","text":"The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) allows one to remotely access a terminal interface on a remote machine.

Public key (aka asymmetric) encryption consists of a pair of keys - the private and public key. Any information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key (and vice-versa). Public keys are shared publicly as the name suggests, while the private key is kept secret. This can be used to create a digital signature , an electronic variant of the handwritten signature, with similar properties: Authentication : Proves that a message was sent by the signer and no one else. Non-repudiation : Someone who has signed a message, cannot later deny they have done so. In addition, a digital signature offers another property which handwritten signatures lack: Integrity : Any alteration to the signed message renders the signature invalid. This brings us to the topic of certificates ( public key certificates ). These are electronic documents which prove that the owner's public key has been verified by some authority (the certificate issuer). This lets us trust the public keys of unknown entities, provided we trust the certificate issuer. In fact, this is how website certificates are issued under TLS , the cryptographic protocol powering HTTPS. SSH Certificates SSH certificates are essentially public SSH keys signed by some authority's private key, and allow the host to authenticate clients. When a client tries to connect to an SSH host, the client proves its identity by showing the host its public key certificate, which is signed by an authority the host trusts. Unlike TLS however, there are no authorities trusted by default (aka root certificate authorities ). The trusted certificate authority on the host must be set by the user. An advantage of using certificates is that all clients with public keys signed by an authority trusted by the host are automatically granted access, and there is no need to add or maintain the client's public keys in the authorized_keys file on the host.","title":"Certificates"},{"location":"blog-posts/2022-02-07-ssh-with-certificates/#1-setting-up-ssh-on-the-host","text":"First, ensure that OpenSSH, the open-source implementation of the SSH protocol and its tools, is installed .

Arthur Schopenhauer It is very likely that the outcome of most things in the world, including the desires 1 and mental states of ourselves and others, are already predetermined by events in the distant past. A criminal or good Samaritan, for example, can be viewed as a person whose antecedent moral, social and genetic factors have resulted in them being bound, so to speak, to have either the desire to help others or a lack of self control resulting in the criminal act. This is not to say that they should not be punished or praised, for we know that such interventions can be beneficial. Rather, we should view their acts with the same amount of significance as we would to our expectations of a faulty program running smoothly or a mouse outrunning a cheetah, because we know that the outcome could not have been otherwise, given the antecedent factors. Under a deterministic worldview, being disappointed with, annoyed, or angry with the behavior of others and ourselves is rather meaningless. It is similar to watching a movie - you may feel disappointed or pleased with the storyline, and if you want to blame anyone, it would be the storywriters, not the characters. The characters simply couldn't have acted any other way. The resulting sense of detachment, of viewing the world from a stoic third person view applies to our own talents and shortcomings - our constitution, both mental and physical, is and was not a product of our conscious decision, but rather of our parents, environment and nature, all of which were determined from the get-go. In fact, even if determinism is false, and things are indetermined, there still remains the principle of causation. Events cause other events, and so long as that is the case, even if the outcome is unpredictable, every event can be viewed as the consequence of other events. In such a case, we would still not be free - even if the future is unpredictable. I am not proposing fatalism - to give up and resign everything to fate. Firstly, practicing fatalism is something extremely difficult to do in itself (try being completely passive and letting life run its course around you for a day). Secondly, and more importantly, being fatalistic is itself a predetermined decision which we are not free to make 2 , and which most of us are not predisposed to choose. We live in a world and a society filled with consequences. Not eating will result in hunger, theft will result in jail, having money will let you buy things, education opens opportunities, and so on. The experience of and knowledge of these consequences indirectly affects our decisions, and for most of us, the resultant consequences of fatalism make it an unpopular decision. The knowledge of determinism by itself does not automatically result in fatalism 3 . How should we act then? Personally, I follow the Stoic worldview 4 . I continue to live my life as normal, making decisions as if I had free will, using (or rather, allowing) knowledge from my experiences to influence my decision making positively, but I do not get hung up about having made a wrong decision, or be fixated with grievances to myself caused by others. What happened, happened, and couldn't have happened any other way. Morpheus, The Matrix Reloaded (2003) I've realized several benefits since practicing Stoicism: I feel more in control of my emotions, such as whether to be angry, annoyed, depressed, happy, or cheerful. I am less affected with other people's opinions of me. Guilt (whether from myself or others) affects me much less when making decisions. Most importantly (and paradoxically), I feel freeier - to do the things I want without regret or guilt, to feel good about my life no matter how stormy, and to love the people important to me. I hope Stoicism helps you as much as it has helped me, to live life fully and experience all it has to offer. I feel the strongest reason that we are not in control of our desires is our gender. It is the strongest determinant of our attraction to the opposite sex, and we were not free to make this decision, it having been decided at birth. \u21a9 We are not free, not to be free, as Sartre wrote: \"Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.\" \u21a9 Unless it was already determined that an individual would pursue fatalism. \u21a9 Some great books are Marcus Aurelius' Meditations , and Epictetus' Enchiridion . \u21a9","title":"Determinism and Stoicism"},{"location":"blog-posts/2022-03-03-determinism-and-stoicism/#determinism-and-stoicism","text":"Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants. Arthur Schopenhauer It is very likely that the outcome of most things in the world, including the desires 1 and mental states of ourselves and others, are already predetermined by events in the distant past. A criminal or good Samaritan, for example, can be viewed as a person whose antecedent moral, social and genetic factors have resulted in them being bound, so to speak, to have either the desire to help others or a lack of self control resulting in the criminal act. This is not to say that they should not be punished or praised, for we know that such interventions can be beneficial. Rather, we should view their acts with the same amount of significance as we would to our expectations of a faulty program running smoothly or a mouse outrunning a cheetah, because we know that the outcome could not have been otherwise, given the antecedent factors. Under a deterministic worldview, being disappointed with, annoyed, or angry with the behavior of others and ourselves is rather meaningless. It is similar to watching a movie - you may feel disappointed or pleased with the storyline, and if you want to blame anyone, it would be the storywriters, not the characters. The characters simply couldn't have acted any other way. The resulting sense of detachment, of viewing the world from a stoic third person view applies to our own talents and shortcomings - our constitution, both mental and physical, is and was not a product of our conscious decision, but rather of our parents, environment and nature, all of which were determined from the get-go. In fact, even if determinism is false, and things are indetermined, there still remains the principle of causation. Events cause other events, and so long as that is the case, even if the outcome is unpredictable, every event can be viewed as the consequence of other events. In such a case, we would still not be free - even if the future is unpredictable. I am not proposing fatalism - to give up and resign everything to fate.

At the time, I was in the military doing clerical work, and there were hundreds of pages of documents that we were supposed to transcribe into Microsoft Word documents. The task itself was extremely monotonous and I was thinking of ways to improve it further. Once I picked up Dvorak, however, my outlook on the work changed. The task became fun, as I found myself slowly beginning to pick up the layout, and learn touch typing (something I had previously never attempted). I think that the experience of learning a skill, or mastering a practice is in itself the source of the majority of our happiness. It is when we see our own personal development, feel that we've become a better person than we were yesterday, which results in contentment. Money may be necessary at the beginning, for example to buy a bicycle for cycling, a computer to type, or paper to write on, but it is really the effort, and progress, of learning and honing a skill which really results in contentment. That contentment is something I have felt ever since picking up programming and subsequently being able to write my own tools and applications. It has made me realize that mastery of a skill itself is what allows us to produce works of value, to ourselves and others. It is the reason we see value in the things we envy - an expensive car, a finely honed mechanical keyboard, an exclusive handbag, or even a beautiful home. We are innately drawn to perfection, the product of skill, talent and deep work . At the moment, I am learning how to use Vim , a modal text editor promising faster navigation and efficiency. It is not easy, and at times I am tempted to give up, and return to the world of mice and GUIs. But there are times when I successfully manage to type an entire article without using the mouse successfully, and it is those moments which keep me on this journey. Perhaps we must follow Sisyphus, constantly challenging ourselves, and that is what gives us contentment and maybe even meaning in our lives.

Use Chrome Private Browsing In private browsing, each time you close and open the window, all existing service workers are terminated. This avoids issues with older service workers persisting despite a new service worker available. Firefox's private browsing, as of 24/3/22, does not support service workers. 2. Ensure npm modules are all up-to-date I had a bizzare issue where the update() method of ServiceWorkerRegistration would refuse to update, if it encountered a single failed network request for the service-worker.js file.
