1. Practice negative visualization regularly. Imagine losing things and people you value most, as well as the loss of your own life.
2. Go further, and engage in voluntary discomfort. Put yourself in socially embarrassing situations like dressing poorly, and physical suffering e.g. underdressing for the cold.
3. Fame and fortune are not worth having.
4. Tranquility is the goal.
5. Avoid befriending people whose values are corrupt.
6. Things which you have no control over - ignore.
7. Things which you have some control over - internalize your goals (e.g. in playing tennis, to play the best match possible), and not the outcome which you cannot control (e.g. winning the match).
8. Things which you have complete control over - these are your goals and values. It could be argued that desires are uncontrollable.
9. Be fatalistic with respect to the past: what has happened to us in the past, and at this very instant, are beyond our control, and so it is foolish to get upset about these things.
