Crispy, roasted pork belly is a really nice snack (and main dish). Lots of recipes on the internet have different variations, some use salt, some involve putting water in the oven as well, and others recommend keeping the raw belly in the refrigerator for 18 hours before putting it in the oven.

In this recipe I keep everything to the minimum, so there's as little cleaning/preparation involved, for the same great taste.

The belly is first cooked at a low temperature while the skin is further dried in the oven with a layer of salt. It's then roasted at a sizzling 230째C to bring out the crispiness.

The salt is necessary for the skin to have that bubbly, crispy texture.

Time required: 2 hours

## Ingredients

-   Pork belly, skin-on
-   Salt

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 140째C.
2. Layer salt evenly over the skin of the pork belly.
3. Place in the oven for around 30 minutes, or when the internal temperature reaches 62째C.
4. Take out from oven and remove the layer of salt crust that has formed.
5. Set the oven to 230째C and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to char.
