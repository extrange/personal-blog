# The Best Way to Cook Beans

Beans (also known as legumes) are an excellent source of protein and fibre, and are also one of the lowest GI (glycemic index) foods available. They are also relatively cheap.

However, legumes contain sugars known as galactooligosaccharides (GOS) which are non-digestible, and hence ferment in the gut. While they have benefits, such as being a prebiotic (stimulating the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut), the fermentation process can cause gassiness, bloating, flatulence and even nausea.

Furthermore, beans also contain compounds known as antinutrients, which prevent uptake of minerals and even protein. These include tannins, phytic acid and lectins. Some substances, such as the lectin phytohaemagglutinin, are even toxic.

Of note, there are also the following methods which while not described in the literature, I believe to have an effect:

-   Discarding cooking water after cooking (i.e. you must have used sufficient water to cook, more than the beans would absorb)
-   Rinsing the beans again after cooking
-   Combining the above

## Reducing GOS

| Method                   | Raw     | Cooked | Autoclaved |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Unsoaked                 | Control | 40-45% | 65-71%     |
| Soaking 12H, water       | 40-45%  | 60-66% | 74-77%     |
| Soaking 12H, baking soda | 43-48%  | 61-67% | 77-80%     |
| Sprouting 24H            | 41-51%  | -      | 62-83%     |
| Sprouting 48H            | 80-88%  | -      | 83-93%     |
| Sprouting 72H or more    | 100%    | -      | 100%       |

Notes:

-   Unless otherwise specified, cooking and autoclaving were done in water, and soaking water was discarded.
-   Autoclaving (121C, 15psi/103kPa) can be replicated at home with the use of a pressure cooker.
-   Unsoaked and cooking in baking soda is generally more effective than with plain water, but the exact amount varies depending on type of bean[^2000], with some beans actually worse off with baking soda.
-   Soaking for 12H is more efective than 6H[^1985]. 12H appears to be the point beyond which additional soaking will not improve GOS/antinutrient loss significantly[^2019]. Soaking also appears to increase the soluble fibre content slightly, with no change in insoluble fibre content[^2019].
-   Soaking in alkaline medium (e.g. baking soda), as compared to water, may cause a destruction of certain B vitamins[^2007].

## Reducing Antinutrients

[Antinutrients][antinutrients] can be classified broadly into two types, heat-stable and heat-sensitive. Heat-stable antinutrients are not easily destroyed with heat, but decrease with sprouting. Heat-sensitive antinutrients are destroyed with heat.

Examples of heat-stable antinutrients include tannins (decreases iron absorption) and phytic acid (decrease absorption of iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium).

Examples of heat-sensitive antinutrients include lectins (which interfere with absorption of calcium, iron, phosphorus and zinc), and saponins (which interfere with normal nutrient absorption).

Heat-stable antinutrients were best removed by a combination of soaking and cooking/autoclaving (60+%) [^2007], or sprouting > 24hr (87-100%).

Heat-sensitive antinutrients were not significantly reduced by sprouting, but were removed almost totally by soaking and cooking/autoclaving.

In both cases, autoclaving was more effective than cooking.

## Cooking with/without discarding soaking water

Tables from this paper[^2010].

| ANTINUTRIENTS            | RESULT OF DISCARDING SOAKING WATER               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Phytates and phytic acid | Desirable and greater loss                       |
| Total phenolic compounds | Desirable and greater loss, most lost by cooking |
| Tannins                  | Desirable and greater loss, most lost by cooking |
| Oligosaccharides         | Desirable and greater loss                       |

| NUTRIENTS                                           | RESULT OF DISCARDING SOAKING WATER                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proteins and respective digestibility               | Varied among studies. No influence.                              |
| Ashes, loss of solids, minerals and bioavailability | Greater loss, but mineral bioavailability increases              |
| Carbohydrates                                       | Varied among studies, does not decrease resistant starch content |
| Fibres                                              | Varied among studies. Reduces substances causing flatulence.     |

## Conclusion

Applying heat is the best way to remove heat-sensitive antinutrients, while sprouting was the best way to remove GOS and heat-stable antinutrients.

Therefore, the best method, taking into account time considerations, would be to soak the beans for 24-48 hours (with not much more benefit over 48 hours), and subsequently autoclaving.

The second best method would be to soak the beans in water and then autoclave them, although this would result in slightly higher levels of GOS and antinutrients.
