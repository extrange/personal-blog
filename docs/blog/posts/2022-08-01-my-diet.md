# My Diet

_Updated 2023-09-04_

I consume wholegrains/legumes, vegetables, tofu and meat (chicken/fish). I aim for [~100g of protein][protein] and 30g fibre per day.

Consuming a variety of vegetables is important, as a single vegetable seldom contains [all the necessary vitamins/nutrients][nutrients].

I [intermittent fast][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). I skip breakfast, eating my first and largest meal of the day at 12 noon, followed by a light/no dinner. From 8pm to 12 noon, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

I batch cook and freeze my lunches/dinners for about a week each time. This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them. This also reduces the bulk of the vegetables, saving space in the fridge.

This is the largest meal of the day for me, and the most important for fibre and protein.

## Snack

This is usually:

-   Fruits (bananas/oranges)
-   Roasted sweet potatoes
-   Nut bars (homemade)
-   Dried prunes

## Dinner/Late afternoon

I eat a protein e.g. chicken breast, eggs, fatty fish (mackerel/salmon/canned sardines), together with a soup of vegetables such as corn, carrots, sweet potatoes or potatoes, to achieve a good [balance of nutrients][nutrients].

Occasionally I take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].
