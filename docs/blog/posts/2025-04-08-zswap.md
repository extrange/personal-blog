# zram vs zswap

A comparison of two memory compression techniques in Linux, which aim to be faster than just using swap, and also reduce writes to swap.

<!-- more -->

## zram

[zram] is a kernel module which creates a RAM-based block device in memory, which can be used for swap, among other purposes.

The main [parameters][zram-parameters] exposed by the module are:

- `comp_algorithm`: Compression algorithm to use
- `disksize`: Size of the block device
- `backing_dev`: A backing device to write incompressible/idle pages to (optional)

zram also allows the user to set a [limit][zram-writeback-limit] on the amount of writeback to swap, which can help to prolong the life of SSDs.

The [best compression algorithm] appears to be `zstd`.

The current statistics can be viewed with `zramctl`:

```
‚ùØ zramctl
NAME       ALGORITHM DISKSIZE DATA COMPR TOTAL STREAMS MOUNTPOINT
/dev/zram0 zstd         15.6G  28M  7.2M  8.6M       8 [SWAP]
```

zram can be enabled on NixOS with the [zram module].

## zswap

[zswap] is another kernel module which acts as a compressed cache in RAM, for swap pages. It intercepts pages in the process of being swapped out, and compresses them in RAM. See a thorough explanation on [LWN.net][zswap-lwn].

The main parameters exposed by the module are (see all with `ls -1 /sys/module/zswap/parameters/`):

- `compressor`: Compression algorithm to use
- `max_pool_percent`: Maximum percentage of RAM to use for zswap
- `zpool`: The zpool (compressed memory allocator) to use
- `shrinker_enabled`: Whether to proactively write cold pages to swap

The current parameters can be viewed with:

```sh
grep -r . /sys/module/zswap/parameters/
```

Current statistics can be viewed via the debugfs interface:

```sh
grep -r . /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/
```

Extra documentation for the choices of parameters (e.g. `zpool`) can be found in the [Memory Management Kconfig menu] and on the [Arch Wiki][arch-zswap].

??? note "NixOS"

    To enable zswap on NixOS, since there is currently [no zswap option module], it can be set with kernel parameters instead, e.g.:

    ```nix
    boot.kernelParams = [
        "zswap.enabled=1"
        "zswap.compressor=zstd"
        "zswap.zpool=zsmalloc"
        "zswap.max_pool_percent=50"
        "zswap.shrinker_enabled=1"
    ];

    boot.initrd.kernelModules = [
        "zsmalloc"
        # Enable other modules as required, e.g.
        # "lz4"
        # "z3fold"
    ];

    # Note that you also need a swap device setup, e.g.:
    swapDevices = [
        {
            device = "/swapfile";
            size = 16 * 1024;
        }
    ];
    ```

    The list of kernel parameters available can be viewed from source [here][zswap-kernel-parameters] (the parameters to `module_param_cb` and `module_param_named`).

    You can view the current Kconfig parameters with `zcat /proc/config.gz`.

??? note "Test zswap"

    To check that zswap is working and writing back to swap:

    ```sh
    # Stress memory
    stress-ng --vm 2 --vm-bytes 4G --timeout 60s

    # Check that written_back_pages is increasing
    watch -n 1 grep -r . /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/
    ```

## Virtual Memory Kernel Configuration

As these swap devices are faster than the filesystem, the swappiness and other parameters should be [increased accordingly]:

```
vm.swappiness = 180
vm.watermark_boost_factor = 0
vm.watermark_scale_factor = 125
vm.page-cluster = 0
```

## Comparison

LinuxReviews found that on a memory constrained device compiling Chrome, zram was faster than zswap ([article][zswap-linux-reviews]).

Currently I use zram with a disksize of 200% of RAM (suggested by [this][zram-potential]) on my 8G laptop.
