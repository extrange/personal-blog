The entire process of mountaineering is itself a meditative experience; technological isolation fosters introspection, strenous but measured physical exertion gives focus to thought, and the sublime beauty of the landscape frees the imagination.

The desolate vastness of the terrain, the harsh cold of the snow, the pale starlight trillions of kilometers away, the disconnection from society - altogether, they culminate in the realization that one's worldy concerns stand for naught in this court of the Universe.
