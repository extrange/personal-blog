[^alan-watts]: I'm a big fan of Alan Watts, an American who was deeply involved in the promotion of Japanese Zen to the world. His [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khOaAHK7efc) and [writings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514210.The_Way_of_Zen) are frank, witty and hint at the beauty of his thought.
[^lucid-dreaming]: Think being able to travel anywhere in the world whenever you sleep. Or speak to anyone, living or dead, knowing that it's your subconscious replying you.
