Hi there! :wave:

I'm Nicholas and I work as a junior doctor in Singapore.

I'm interested in Machine and Deep Learning, and how it can be used to improve the delivery of healthcare in medical informatics. At the moment, I'm making a [web app](https://app.nicholaslyz.com) -  a dashboard, to view and organize my tasks, investments, booklists and more all on one page. I'm also exploring algorithmic trading!

I read, run and play the piano and badminton. I'm also into <u>[mountaineering](mountaineering.md)</u>, <u>[photography](photography.md)</u> and <u>[investing](blog-posts/2020-11-30-getting-started-with-investing.md)</u>. I'm also interested in Zen[^alan-watts] and [lucid dreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/73ih3x/start_here_beginner_guides_faqs_and_resources/)[^lucid-dreaming].

[^alan-watts]: I'm a big fan of Alan Watts, an American who was deeply involved in the promotion of Japanese Zen to the world. His [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khOaAHK7efc) and [writings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514210.The_Way_of_Zen) are frank, witty and hint at the beauty of his thought.
[^lucid-dreaming]: Think being able to travel anywhere in the world whenever you sleep. Or speak to anyone, living or dead, knowing that it's your subconscious replying you.
