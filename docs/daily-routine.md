# Daily Routine

This is the implementation of the [principles] I base my lifestyle on.

Over the years I have been slowly incorporating various practices and routines which I have learnt about from [friends] and [scientific journals], to improve my physical and mental well-being.

While there are many more potential changes that I could make with regards to this lifestyle to further optimize the benefits, I have decided to select the minimal set with the largest benefit to inconvenience ratio (as judged by myself).

## Morning Routine

**Light exposure**: Immediately after waking up, I try to head outside, such as when I cycle to work, or head to the market to get groceries. Also, throughout the day, I try to go outdoors. These light exposures help in retraining the circadian rhythm and improving mood.

**[Breakfast](#breakfast)**.

**Exercise**: I cycle to work, run, gym, or on the weekends, play badminton/hike.

## Intellectual Stimulation

**Books**: I keep a [book list], which I read on my [Kindle]. I find studying something novel or challenging such as plumbing, acoustics, TCP/IP, reverse engineering or cryptography actually lifts my mood. Conversely, fiction, such as manga/fanfiction, helps expand my imagination.

**Games**: Video games can be an incredible source of creativity and imagination. Some games like Starcraft and Diablo II were so ahead of their time. I found Mirror's Edge to be fun as well.

**News**: I curate my own RSS feed from various sources such as blogs, Youtube and reputable news sites, categorized in diverse topics such as technology, philosophy or science. I try to avoid mass-market, addictive, low quality sources like Facebook, Instagram, or the mainstream media in my country. I'm currently trialing a Telegram channel, to consolidate interesting articles from all of my friends. To collate articles to read later, I use tools like [Wallabag].

**Piano**: A nice song uplifts the mood. I have some [recordings].

**Podcasts/Audiobooks**: I have found the spoken work to be indispensible while traveling, exercising or otherwise engaged in various activities which preclude reading.

**Programming**: I work on various [programming projects]. I use a streamlined [workflow] consisting of various tools and settings, which I have developed over time.

**Watching**: I maintain a list of movies and shows to watch. In addition, my RSS feed aggregator also tracks video channels which I find interesting.

## Evening Routine

**Meal prep**: Twice a week, I batch cook and freeze my lunches/dinners for about 4-7 days worth at a time. This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them. It also reduces the bulk of the vegetables, saving space in the fridge.

**No electronic distractions after 6pm**: After 6pm, my phone is on DND with no notifications (except for critical ones). Surprises (good or bad) this late in the day can ruin sleep.

**No blue light from 630pm**: I use incandescent lighting indoors. I try to avoid using my phone/computer if possible. If I have to head out, I wear [blue blocker glasses]. Blue light adverse affects the circadian rhythm and subsequent sleep quality.

**Warm shower**: This prevents an adrenaline surge at night (compared to a cold shower).

**[Brown noise]**: I play brown noise to drown out distracting noises, which is common where I am.

**Relaxation**: Then, the rest of the time before bed is spent reading (usually on my [Kindle]), practicing the piano, MMO or [meditating][benefits of meditation].

## Diet

**Legumes/wholegrains, vegetables, tofu and protein (chicken/fish)**: I aim for at least [~100g of protein][protein] and 30g of dietary fibre per day. To minimize antinutrients and maximize nutrients I follow [certain practices][cooking-beans] when preparing the legumes.

Consuming a variety of vegetables is important, as a single vegetable seldom contains [all the necessary vitamins/nutrients][nutrients].

**Intermittent Fasting**: I [intermittent fast][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). I eat the most at breakfast, less at lunch, and skip dinner. From 12 noon onwards, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

_I was previously doing IF for lunch/dinner, but recently shifted the window earlier as an empty stomach before bed improves my sleep. Also, I'm not unwaveringly strict about IF - I do eat dinner from time to time and simply shift breakfast to lunch the next day._

### Breakfast

This is the largest meal of the day for me, and the [most important][nutrients] for fibre and protein, consisting of wholegrains/legumes, tau kwa, nuts and fruits. I sometimes drink [tea](blog/posts/2022-10-28-nutrition-and-health.md#tea).

### Snack

This varies, but I sometimes also eat:

-   Chicken breast
-   Fatty fish (mackerel/salmon/canned sardines)
-   Edamame
-   Random leftover food

Occasionally I take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].

### Lunch

This is usually a defrosted pack of precooked steamed vegetables:

-   Broccoli
-   Cauliflower
-   Sweet potato
-   Ginger
-   Shiitake mushrooms

I stop eating by about 12 noon.

## Misc

**Reminders for chores**: I schedule reminders at fixed days on my calendar for chores like grocery shopping, soaking and cooking lentils. This helps me plan the rest of my schedule around those chores.
