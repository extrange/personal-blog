It is very likely that the outcome of most things in the world, including the desires[^genetic-factors] and mental states of ourselves and others, are already predetermined by events in the distant past. A criminal or good Samaritan, for example, can be viewed as a person whose antecedent moral, social and genetic factors have resulted in them being bound, so to speak, to have either the desire to help others or a lack of self control resulting in the criminal act. This is not to say that they should not be punished or praised, for we know that such interventions can be beneficial. Rather, we should view their acts with the same amount of significance as we would to our expectations of a faulty program running smoothly or a mouse outrunning a cheetah, because we know that the outcome could not have been otherwise, given the antecedent factors. 

Under a deterministic worldview, being disappointed with, annoyed, or angry with the behavior of others and ourselves is rather meaningless. It is similar to watching a movie - you may feel disappointed or pleased with the storyline, and if you want to blame anyone, it would be the storywriters, not the characters. The characters simply couldn't have acted any other way. The resulting sense of detachment, of viewing the world from a stoic third person view applies to our own talents and shortcomings - our constitution, both mental and physical, is and was not a product of our conscious decision, but rather of our parents, environment and nature, all of which were determined from the get-go.

I am not proposing fatalism - to give up and resign everything to fate. Firstly, practicing fatalism is something extremely difficult to do in itself (try being completely passive and letting life run its course around you for a day). Secondly, and more importantly, being fatalistic is itself a predetermined decision which we are not free to make, and which most of us are not predisposed to choose. We live in a world and a society filled with consequences. Not eating will result in hunger, theft will result in jail, having money will let you buy things, education opens opportunities, and so on. The experience of and knowledge of these consequences indirectly affects our decisions, and for most of us, the resultant consequences of fatalism make it an unpopular decision. The knowledge of determinism by itself does not automatically result in fatalism[^fatalism].

Personally, I follow the Stoic worldview[^stoicism]. I continue to live my life as normal, making decisions as if I had free will, using (or rather, allowing) knowledge from my experiences to influence my decision making positively, but I do not get hung up about having made a wrong decision, or be fixated with grievances to myself caused by others.

I've realized several benefits since practicing Stoicism:

- I feel more in control of my emotions, such as whether to be angry, annoyed, depressed, happy, or cheerful.
- I am less affected with other people's opinions of me.
- Guilt (whether from myself or others) affects me much less when making decisions.
- Most importantly (and paradoxically), I feel freeier - to do, feel and love the things I want and the people important to me. 

I hope Stoicism helps you as much as it has helped me, to live life more freely and experience all it has to offer.

[^genetic-factors]: I feel the strongest reason that we are not in control of our desires is our gender. It is the strongest determinant of our attraction to the opposite sex, and we were not free to make this decision, it having been decided at birth.
[^fatalism]: Unless it was already determined that an individual would pursue fatalism.
[^stoicism]: Some great books are Marcus Aurelius' [Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations), and Epictetus' [Enchiridion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2085705.Discourses_and_Enchiridion).
