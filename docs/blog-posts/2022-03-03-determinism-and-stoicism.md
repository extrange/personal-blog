It is very likely that the outcome of most things in the world, including the desires and mental states of ourselves and others, are already predetermined by processes set forth in the distant past. A criminal or good Samaritan, for example, can be viewed as a person whose antecedent moral, social and genetic factors[^genetic-factors] have resulted in a being who was bound, so to speak, to have either the desire to help others or a lack of self control. This is not to say that they should not be punished or praised, for we know that such interventions can be beneficial. Rather, we should assign the same amount of significance to their acts as we would to our expectations of a faulty program running smoothly or a mouse outrunning a cheetah, which is to say none, because we know the likely outcome. 

Because of this determinism, being disappointed with, annoyed, or angry with the behavior of others and ourselves is rather meaningless. It is similar to watching a movie with an outcome you dislike - you may feel disappointed with the decision the storywriters made, but not toward the characters, because they couldn't have acted any other way - it was already determined by the storywriters how they would act. This sense of detachment, of viewing the world from a stoic third person view applies even to our own talents and shortcomings - our constitution, both mental and physical, is and was not a product of our conscious decision, but rather of our parents, environment and nature, all of which are beyond our control.

This sounds like fatalism - to simply give up, and resign everything to fate, but it is not. Firstly, practicing fatalism is something extremely difficult to do in itself (try being completely passive and letting life run its course around you for a day). Secondly, and more importantly, being fatalistic is itself a decision, a predetermined one, which most of us are not predisposed to make. We live in a world and a society filled with consequences. Not eating will result in hunger, theft will result in jail, having money will let you buy things, education opens opportunities, and so on. The experience of and knowledge of these consequences indirectly affects our decisions, and for most of us, the resultant consequences of fatalism make it an unpopular decision. The knowledge of determinism by itself does not automatically result in fatalism[^fatalism].

# How should we act then, if determinism is true?

Personally, I follow the Stoic worldview[^stoicism]. I continue to live my life making decisions as if I had free will, using (or rather, allowing) knowledge from my experiences to influence my decision making. I do not get hung up about having made a wrong decision, or get fixated with grievances to myself caused by others. What happened, happened, and couldn't have happened any other way[^matrix].

I've realized several benefits since practicing Stoicism:

- I feel more in control of my emotions, such as whether to be angry, annoyed, depressed, happy, or cheerful.
- I am less affected with other people's opinions of me.
- Guilt (whether from myself or others) affects me much less when making decisions.
- Most importantly (and paradoxically), I feel freeier - to do, feel and love the things I want and the people important to me. 

I hope Stoicism helps you as much as it has helped me, to live life more freely and experience all it has to offer.


[^genetic-factors]: I feel the strongest reason that we are not in control of our desires is our gender. It is the strongest determinant of our attraction to the opposite sex, and we were not free to make this decision, it having been decided at birth.
[^fatalism]: Unless it was already determined that an individual would pursue fatalism.
[^stoicism]: Some great books are Marcus Aurelius' [Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations), and Epictetus' [Enchiridion].
[^matrix]: 
    From [The Matrix Reloaded (2003)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/characters/nm0000401):

    Neo : Well, that didn't go so well.

    Morpheus : Are you Certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?

    Neo : Yes.

    Trinity : Maybe we did something wrong.

    Neo : Or didn't do something.

    Morpheus : No, what happened, happened and couldn't have happened any other way.

    Neo : How do you know?

    Morpheus : We are still alive.
