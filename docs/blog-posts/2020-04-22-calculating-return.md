# Calculating Return (work in progress)

Returns. The quintessential word we hear when evaluating a fund, looking at our CPF, or even when buying insurance (ill-advised).

How do we actually calculate the return of our portfolio, when we add/withdraw funds from it over the course of time? Let's consider an example.

On 1 Jan 2020, John invests $100. In Jun, the market went up and his portfolio is now worth $200. He invests another $100. By the next year, on 1 Jan 2021, the markets remained flat - leaving him with $300 in his account. What is his return?

- Surely, his return is not $300 - $100 = $200 (200%), because he invested $200 in total.
- Neither does it seem to be $300 - $200 = $100 (50%) - it is clear that between Jan 20 and Jun, he made a 100% return ($100 -> $200)
- We know therefore his return should be between 50-200%, but what is it?

There are two widely accepted ways to solve this problem, the Time - Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR), and the Money - Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR) (which is equivalent to the Internal Rate of Return, IRR).

## Time - Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)

Formula

- The product of all returns for periods where money moves in/out of the portfolio 
- insensitive to cash inflows/outflows (i.e., it is the return one would have got if they invested everything right at the start)
- requires valuation of the portfolio at each time point
- therefore better suited for portfolio managers, who cannot control inflows/outflows


## Money - Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR)

Also known as the Internal Rate of Return.

Formula

- equivalent to the internal rate of return (for an investment, in this case your portfolio)
- assumes cashflow in each period is continuously invested in subsequent periods
- suitable if you are in control of the cashflows in/out of the portfolio
- does not require portfolio valuations at each calculation point
