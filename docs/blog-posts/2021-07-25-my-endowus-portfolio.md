# My Endowus Portfolio

I recently started an Endowus portfolio ([reasons](2021-07-25-endowus-or-not.md)). Here's the funds I chose and my allocation:

| %   | Fund                                               | Tracked Index                                            |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 50% | [Dimensional World Equity Fund][wef]               | [MSCI All Country World Index][acwi]                     |
| 30% | [Dimensional Global Targeted Value Fund][gtvf]     | MSCI World SMID Value Index[^wsvi]                       |
| 20% | [Dimensional Global Core Fixed Income Fund][gcfif] | [Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index][bbgabi] |

A few small changes here compared to my [IBKR portfolio](2021-01-16-my-investment-portfolio.md), but my investment philosophy remains the same.

First, I buy into global mid- and large-cap companies with [Dimensional's World Equity Fund][wef] (net expense ratio of 0.35% pa).

Secondly, I add exposure to developed small- and mid-cap companies with [Dimensional's Global Targeted Value Fund][gtvf] (net expense ratio 0.49% pa). Note that there is an overlap here of developed mid-cap companies with the World Equity Fund - this is because there isn't a Dimensional fund offered by Endowus which tracks the [MSCI World Small Cap Index][wsci] like [WSML][wsml].

Finally, I keep 20% of my portfolio in duration diversified, investment grade bonds across the world with [Dimensional's Global Core Fixed Income Fund][gcfif] (net expense ratio 0.28% pa).

You might note that there isn't any investment in property or REITS here, and that is because Endowus doesn't have this category of fund (maybe in the future).

And that is how I achieve my 80/20 equity/bond split with Endowus!

[^wsvi]: Unfortunately, I couldn't find the prospectus document by MSCI for this index - the closest is the [MSCI World SMID Cap Index](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/42e6c200-1e4e-496f-a318-42499ab8b128).
