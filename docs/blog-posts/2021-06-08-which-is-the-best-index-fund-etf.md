# The Best Index Fund (or ETF)

I've been advocating for [broad based, index investing](2020-11-30-getting-started-with-investing.md) if you follow my blog.

But with so many options, which is the best?

## [ISAC](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251850/ishares-msci-acwi-ucits-etf), [WSML](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund), [IWDA](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/), [CSPX](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/253743/) and [VWRA](https://www.vanguardinvestments.dk/portal/instl/dk/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9679/assetCode=equity/?overview)

Let's look at how they compare. Take note of the **expense ratio** and **fund size** (this affects liquidity, or the bid/ask spread[^bid-ask-spread]).

| As of 2021-06-02    | CSPX             | ISAC             | IMID             | IWDA             | WSML             | VWRA             |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Expense Ratio (%)   | 0.07             | 0.20             | 0.40             | 0.20             | 0.35             | 0.22             |
| Fund Size           | 45B              | 2.4B             | 0.27B            | 36B              | 4.2B             | 2.6B             |
| Developed Large Cap | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: |                  | :material-check: |

| Developed Small Cap |                  |                  | :material-check: |                  | :material-check: |                  |
| Emerging Large Cap  |                  | :material-check: | :material-check: |                  |                  | :material-check: |
| Emerging Mid Cap    |                  | :material-check: | :material-check: |                  |                  | :material-check: |
| Emerging Small Cap  |                  |                  | :material-check: |                  |                  |                  |
    
I previously used the CSPX + IWDA combo, as ISAC had an expense ratio of 0.6% (I don't like anything above 0.5%). However, the expense ratio of ISAC has since dropped to 0.2%, making ISAC more attractive. ISAC includes mid and large-cap emerging market stocks, while the CSPX + IWDA combo does not. Also, ISAC does all this in 1 ETF, instead of 2.

**I combine ISAC together with WSML** (expense ratio of 0.35%), to ensure I am invested globally in small to large-cap stocks across developing and emerging markets.

While the ISAC + WSML combo does not include emerging small cap markets, to me this isn't a problem - I think emerging small caps are quite a gamble. That's my opinion.

## FAQ

### Why ISAC over VWRA?
[VWRA](https://www.vanguardinvestments.dk/portal/instl/dk/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9679/?overview) is a Vanguard fund dormiciled in Ireland, tracking the [FTSE All-World index](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/Factsheets/Home/DownloadSingleIssue?issueName=AWORLDS&IsManual=false), an index covering large and mid-cap companies across developed and developing markets which claims to track 98% of the world investible market capitalization. The [MSCI ACWI Index](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb) on the other hand, tracks 85% of the global investible set. Apart from [some other minor differences](https://www.bankeronwheels.com/best-international-etfs/), the MSCI and FTSE World indices are similar in that they include mid to large-cap stocks in developing and developed countries. I wouldn't fret over the differences too much. If you're already in ISAC, keep it. Otherwise, you can consider buying VWRA to begin with.

### Why not [IMID](https://markets.ft.com/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=IMID:LSE:USD)? This includes small to large-cap stocks across developing AND developed markets!
The main reason is due to the small fund size at the moment (0.27B), and the higher expense ration (0.4%). Otherwise, it is an attractive option, being 1 ETF instead of 2.

[^bid-ask-spread]: This is the difference between the price you buy and sell at. Lower liquidity means this gap will be bigger.
