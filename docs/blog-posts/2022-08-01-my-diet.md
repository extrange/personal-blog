# My Diet

I have been experimenting with several dietary patterns over the years, and I have finally settled on the following (with reasons below).

## Schedule

I practice intermittent fasting, following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). In essence, I skip breakfast, eating my first meal of the day at 12nn, followed by dinner between 6-8pm. Between 8pm to 12nn, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

The main motivation behind this schedule (which I started in 2020) was the publication[^if-nejm] of a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, which showed increased longevity, stress resistance, with a decrease in diseases including cancer and obesity.

## Lunch

This is what I eat:

-   160g rolled oats
-   50-100ml unsweetened plant milk (e.g. soybean)
-   15g chia seeds
-   5g psyllium husk powder
-   5g wheatgrass powder (optional)
-   8 drops stevia
-   Water as necessary

The above is soaked overnight.

In the morning, I add:

-   Nuts (e.g baked almonds)
-   Fruits: Watermelon, grapes, papaya, pineapples etc.

This is the largest meal of the day for me, consisting of mainly wholegrains, fibre and fruits. I settled on oats as the choice of carbohydrate, in particular due to its [beta glucan][beta-glucan] content which can help reduce cholesterol and promote cardiovascular health.

I also take psyllium husk, in the form of a powder. There is a positive effect with regards to weight loss, satiety, hunger and even glycemic and lipid control.

## Dinner

This is usually a protein, such as chicken breast, tofu, eggs or fatty fish such as mackerel or salmon. I add whatever vegetables I happen to have that day as well. This high protein meal coincides with my evening workouts as well (usually running or gymming).

While there is [debate][protein-requirement] about how much protein one should take daily, especially if they are exercising, I stick to around 1.7g/kg (about 100g/day).

I have cut down on red meat (pork, beef and lamb), as there is [strong evidence][iarc-red-meat] it is a carcinogen. Processed meat, on the other hand, is a known carcinogen, so I completely avoid it (smoked, cured, salted or fermented).
