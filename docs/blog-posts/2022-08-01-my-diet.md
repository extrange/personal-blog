# My Diet

I consume wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, tofu and chicken/fish meat. I aim for [~100g of protein][protein] per day.

I [intermittent fast][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). I skip breakfast, eating my first meal of the day at 12 noon, followed by dinner between 6-8pm. From 8pm to 12 noon, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food (ideally, I would fast from 6pm to 12 noon (the 18:6 schedule), but this is limited by when I end work).

I batch cook and freeze my lunches/dinners for about a week each time. This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them. This also reduces the bulk of the vegetables, saving space in the fridge.

This is the largest meal of the day for me.

## Snack

Fruits like bananas and oranges, or vegetables like roasted sweet potatoes.

## Dinner/Late afternoon

I eat a protein, e.g. chicken breast, tofu, eggs or fatty fish such as mackerel, salmon or canned sardines, sometimes with random leftover vegetables.

Occasionally I take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].
