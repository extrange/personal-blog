# My Diet

I have been experimenting with several dietary patterns over the years, and I have finally settled on the following (with reasons below).

In general, I consume wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, tofu and chicken/fish meat. I aim for [~100g of protein][protein] per day.

Preparing this meal takes about 5 minutes in the morning (cutting fruits, soaking beans), and about 20 minutes in the evening (cooking beans, chicken breast in a pressure cooker, preparing vegetables for the next day).

## Timing

I practice [intermittent fasting][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). In essence, I skip breakfast, eating my first meal of the day at 12 noon, followed by dinner between 6-8pm. Between 8pm to 12 noon, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

Ideally I would fast from 6pm to 12 noon (the 18:6 schedule), but this is limited by when I end work.

## Breakfast

I sometimes take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil], but otherwise I do not take any calories.

## Lunch

This is the largest meal of the day for me, consisting of mainly legumes/lentils/wholegrains, fruits, vegetables and tofu.

-   180g mixed beans (dry weight, [soaked][soaking], pressure cooked, 3 scoops)
-   1 [potato][satiety]
-   28g chia seeds (1 scoop)
-   5g [psyllium husk powder][psyllium] (4 small teaspoons)
-   Drops of stevia to taste
-   Water, as necessary to dissolve the above
-   Fruits
-   Baked whole nuts/nut butter/nut powders

Total fibre content of the above, excluding fruits/nuts: (180g \* 12%) + (28g \* 34%) + 5 ~ **36g**

In addition, I also eat a block of tau kwa (250g together with vegetables).

## Dinner

I usually exercise in the evening, so this meal consists of mainly a protein, such as chicken breast, tofu, eggs or fatty fish such as mackerel or salmon. I then add whatever vegetables I happen to have that day as well.
