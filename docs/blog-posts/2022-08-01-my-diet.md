# My Diet

I have been experimenting with several dietary patterns over the years, and I have finally settled on the following (with reasons below).

In general, I consume wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, tofu and chicken/fish meat. I aim for [~100g of protein][protein] per day.

## Timing

I practice [intermittent fasting][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). In essence, I skip breakfast, eating my first meal of the day at 12 noon, followed by dinner between 6-8pm. Between 8pm to 12 noon, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

Ideally I would fast from 6pm to 12 noon (the 18:6 schedule), but this is limited by when I end work.

## Breakfast

None

## Lunch

This is the largest meal of the day for me, consisting of mainly legumes/lentils/wholegrains, fruits, vegetables and tofu.

-   500g cooked beans/lentils
-   Fruits
-   28g chia seeds (1 scoop)
-   5g [psyllium husk powder][psyllium] (4 small teaspoons)
-   Baked whole nuts/nut butter/nut powders
-   Drops of stevia to taste

Total fibre content of the above, excluding fruits/nuts: ~20g + (28g \* 34%) + 5 ~ **36g**

In addition, I also eat a block of tau kwa (250g together with vegetables).

## Dinner

I usually exercise in the evening, so this meal consists of mainly a protein, such as chicken breast, tofu, eggs or fatty fish such as mackerel or salmon. I then add whatever vegetables I happen to have that day as well.

I sometimes take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].

Around once a week, I stock up, cook and freeze:

-   Beans/lentils (without soaking[^without-soaking], in pressure cooker)
-   Vegetables
-   Chicken breast/fish/tau kwa (tau kwa can be eaten straight out of the packet)

This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them.

## Grocery List

In order of frequency:

-   Vegetables (broccoli, bok choy, carrots, garlic, onion, beetroot etc)
-   Tau kwa
-   Chicken breast
-   Fish (mackerel, salmon, canned sardines/mackerel)
-   Dried beans/lentils (soy, kidney, red, chickpeas etc)
-   Whey protein isolate
-   Psyllium husk powder
-   Chia seeds
-   Nuts
-   Stevia (liquid form)
