Apple chips are a nice and healthy snack. I made some the other day and it's super easy.

Time required: 3 hours

## Ingredients

- Fresh apples ([Gala apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(apple)) taste the best)

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 120°C.
2. Cut apples thinly into ~5mm slices. If you have a mandoline it's easier.
3. Place in the oven for 2 hours.
4. Let it sit in the oven for another 30 mins.
5. Once it cools down, it'll become crispy.
6. The chips go well with a salted caramel dip!

## Notes

- I tried using a dehydrator (70°C for 12 hours), but they aren't as crispy as this oven method.
