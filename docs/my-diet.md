# My Diet

I consume wholegrains/legumes, vegetables, tofu and meat (chicken/fish). I aim for [~100g of protein][protein] and 30g fibre per day. To minimize antinutrients and maximize nutrients I follow [certain practices][cooking-beans] when preparing the legumes.

Consuming a variety of vegetables is important, as a single vegetable seldom contains [all the necessary vitamins/nutrients][nutrients].

I batch cook and freeze my lunches/dinners for about a week each time. This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them. This also reduces the bulk of the vegetables, saving space in the fridge.

## Breakfast

I drink [tea](blog/posts/2022-10-28-nutrition-and-health.md#tea) or water.

I [intermittent fast][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). I skip breakfast, eating my first and largest meal of the day at 12 noon, followed by a light/no dinner. From 8pm to 12 noon, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

## Lunch

This is the largest meal of the day for me, and the most important for fibre and protein.

## Snack

This is usually:

-   Fruits (bananas/oranges)
-   Roasted sweet potatoes
-   Nut bars (homemade)
-   Dried prunes

## Dinner/Late afternoon

I eat either or both of a protein e.g. chicken breast, eggs, fatty fish (mackerel/salmon/canned sardines), or boiled soup of corn, carrots, sweet potatoes or potatoes, to achieve a good [balance of nutrients][nutrients].

Occasionally I take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].
