# My Lifestyle

![](static/images/life.jpg)

Over the years I have been slowly incorporating various practices and routines which I have learnt about from [friends] and [scientific journals], to improve my physical and mental well-being.

While there are many more potential changes that I could make with regards to this lifestyle to further optimize the benefits, I have decided to select the minimal set with the largest benefit to inconvenience ratio (as judged by myself).

## Morning Routine

**Light exposure**: Immediately after waking up, I try to head outside, such as when I cycle to work, or head to the market to get groceries. Then, throughout the day, I try to go outdoors. These light exposures help in retraining the circadian rhythm.

**Breakfast**: See [below](./my-lifestyle.md#breakfast).

## Evening Routine

**Meal prep**: Twice a week, I batch cook and freeze my lunches/dinners for about 4-7 days worth at a time. This lets me take advantage of food on offer, as I can buy more in bulk and freeze them. It also reduces the bulk of the vegetables, saving space in the fridge.

**No electronic distractions after 6pm**: After 6pm, my phone is on DND with no notifications (except for critical ones). Surprises this late in the day can ruin sleep.

**No blue light from 630pm**: I use incandescent lighting indoors. I try to avoid using my phone/computer if possible. If I have to head out, I wear [blue blocker glasses]. Blue light adverse affects the circadian rhythm and subsequent sleep quality. 

**Warm shower**: This prevents an adrenaline surge at night (compared to a cold shower).

**[Brown noise]**: I play brown noise using either my phone or speakers. This helps drown out distracting noises, common where I am.

**Relaxation**: Then, the rest of the time before bed is spent reading (usually on my [Kindle]), practicing the piano, or [meditating][benefits of meditation].

## Reminders

I schedule reminders at fixed days on my calendar for chores like grocery shopping, soaking and cooking lentils. This helps me plan the rest of my schedule around those chores.

## Diet

**Legumes/wholegrains, vegetables, tofu and protein (chicken/fish)**: I aim for at least [~100g of protein][protein] and 30g of dietary fibre per day. To minimize antinutrients and maximize nutrients I follow [certain practices][cooking-beans] when preparing the legumes.

Consuming a variety of vegetables is important, as a single vegetable seldom contains [all the necessary vitamins/nutrients][nutrients].

**Intermittent Fasting**: I [intermittent fast][if-schedule], following the [16/8][16/8] schedule (time restricted eating). I eat the most at breakfast, less at lunch, and skip dinner. From 12 noon onwards, I only drink water/tea, and I do not take any food.

_I was previously doing IF for lunch/dinner, but recently shifted the window earlier as an empty stomach before bed improves my sleep._

### Breakfast

This is the largest meal of the day for me, and the most important for fibre and protein, consisting of lentils, tau kwa, eggs and fruits. I sometimes drink [tea](blog/posts/2022-10-28-nutrition-and-health.md#tea).

### Lunch/Late Morning Snack

I eat either or both of a protein e.g. chicken breast, fatty fish (mackerel/salmon/canned sardines), or a boiled soup of corn, carrots, sweet potatoes and potatoes, to achieve a good [balance of nutrients][nutrients].

Occasionally I take supplements e.g. [fish oil][fish-oil].

I stop eating by about 12 noon.
