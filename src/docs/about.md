I work as a doctor in Singapore. I've all sorts of interests and hobbies, from philosophy, photography to programming. What follows is a bit about my life.

I started out by reading books about computer hacking. Long ago, I borrowed a book on computer security (it was a thick book with a picture of a chessboard). I read about NMAP, TCP/IP, exploits on the IIS server (CodeRed), Windows LANMAN...though I didn't understand much then, I knew I really wanted to learn more about computers.

> "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures." - Frederic P. Brooks

I was interested in computers and IT since I was in primary school. The web was in its infancy then; I still remember using 56kbps dialup.  Ironically, most of my interest came about when my parents locked my computer and I had to figure out ways of circumvention (booting Linux, keyloggers...). I learnt about networking from trying to configure the routers in my house mostly by trial and error - those IT people my parents called charged something north of $50 just for tweaking settings like DHCP or DNS and security. The 1999 movie 'The Matrix' was also a big inspiration to me.

I read [The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/746747.The_Art_of_Computer_Virus_Research_and_Defense) sometime in the 2000s. It read like a novel, detailing the different methods virus writers would use, and the catch up game antivirus vendors would play. Some of the methods (like polymorphic encryption, virtual machines) used by the virus writers were incredibly complicated, but yet, amazingly, the authors of the book were able to provide a detection heuristic for them.

Later on, my portable hard drive, filled with most of my personal data collected over many years, crashed. My diaries, personal notes, photos were gone. That was when I began reading on filesystems ($MFT, streams, MBR/GPT) and data recovery (I couldn't buy EnCase so I made do with dd and a hex editor). Although I wasn't successful in recovering my data, I finally understood how filesystems and their fault tolerance mechanisms worked.

I briefly read about x86 assembly and reverse engineering. I was inspired by the crackers of the day (Razor 1911, FAiRLiGHT, DEViANCE) and the demoscene. People could do crazy things with pure machine code - rgba made an entire mountain simulation with music in 4kB! I tried briefly reverse engineering some small programs. I found it rather complicated, and although I did succeed with some (patching with NOPs), I never really continued programming with assembly.

In high school I played mostly with the Windows OS and its internals. I had fun with bruteforcing Windows passwords with tools like L0phtCrack/Cain and Abel. It was also my introduction to the world of cryptography, spurred further by allegations that the US government was decrypting internet communications and had the capability to decrypt 128-bit AES.

I've written a program to search for image duplicates via convolutional neural networks and cosine similarity in Keras. I've also reversed engineered my house DVR using Wireshark and the sockets library in Python.
