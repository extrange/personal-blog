# Nice HCK DB3
- Soundstage is rather narrow
- Cheap

# ZSN Pro
Basically a fatiguing IEM.

Good:
- cheap
- Bass is not bad - clarity is present especially in 'Cratered'

Bad:
- Mids are recessed. So much so that in '1000 Words' and 'I Want It That Way' the vocals take a back seat, and the treble takes over
- Treble is detail but rather harsh. Definitely not a lounging IEM.

Edit:
- Actually sounds quite tolerable with 'pop' equalizer (basically reduce treble, bring up mids)
