For me, mountaineering is not just a physical challenge, but a meditative, introspective journey. Surrounded by the desolate vastness of the terrain, the cold iciness of the snow, guided by the stars, millions of light years away, my worldly wearies vanish and there is a connection I feel to the mountain, to nature, and to the world. It is special sort of solitude, that is made meaningful by the contrast to city life.
